Thers is also web chat websites that allow you to use a web came and talk to people anywhere in the world. Computers are a great way to get in touch with people. Everyone should have a computer in there home today."
3,"Well computers can be a good or a bad thing. I don'@CAPS1 relay see @CAPS2 computers can be a bad thing for me. I also know @CAPS2 computers can or will help people all around the world. I think computers has positive effects on people like me. Computers teaches hand eye coordination. It can help if you need to find out research for a school project. You can create lots of things on computers like music, designer @CAPS1shirts, logos, banners and lots of other creative things. With computer you can look up available homes and apartments. You can even go online and fill out a job application and save trips to stores @CAPS2 cool is that!! Well I'm a regular person not rich not famous but computers provide lot of information people use today. Thats why I think that computers has a positive effects on people and you don'@CAPS1 have to be super smart to use one."
3,"Dear, @ORGANIZATION1 I think the effects that computers do on people are really positive. Computers can be used for all sorts of things. Examples like finding things out about history. People that changed the world and other information. Computers give the power for children to learn. For example, their are lots of websites that offer online tutoring or good ways to help you pass school. Other positive way is online dating sites. You can meet new people and is a good way to make life even better. Popular sites like @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and so on make a good way to keep in touch with friends from your past, or even make new ones. But the most that I think that's the best in my opinion is going to school online. Once your done with col loge and you are a NYSE, for an example you can get a higher degree like a registered nurse then being a @ORGANIZATION2. I think computers has a positive effect on people."
3,"Dear local newspaper, my name is @PERSON1 I am @NUM1 and I go to Baylor school. I am writing to you convince that computers have a positive effect on people. Please read the following reasons. Computers have a positive effect on people. Your able to communicate with people all over the world. When my brother goes on the computer he get's to talk to my family in @LOCATION1 I like to use Skype because when we talk to family in @CAPS1.R we use a web cam to keep in touch with my family. They teach hand eye coordination and help me in ping pong. It help me ACTH the ball in computer and I do the same in the wreak. You have lot's of access to different information, my mom found a job in the computer. Everybody have access to weather or news, Some say it's a lack of exercise. People get addicted to the computer. Some can get obese and mess with your love life. These are the reasons why I be live computers are good for society. This is why people should agree that advance in technology. Technology keeps on upgrading."
3,"The effect of people using computers isn't anything bad co use you learn a lot from it. In some ways when you use the computer and you type, the typing exercises your fingers. Your fingers will get muscle and will teach you to remember where to type without looking down on the keyboard. People sometimes using computer is good because if your writing letters you don't have to use pencil you can just type it and print. The typing does all the work for you so you won't spend hours writing to someone. Computers are helpful to people for example, Ir your researching about @CAPS1 or @LOCATION1 you can find almost all the information on the computer in a instant click. Computers save time and does a lot of work. Computers are helpful piece of technology and one of the best."
3,"Dear local newspaper, I am writing this letter to you to show on how people get effected from computers. It effects people very well and teaches people many things for just one technology. Computers effects many people for what it does. Computers have many advantages that people learn very quickly. Many people love computers. It is one of the most best inventions to everyone around the world. They teach positive things for people to learn. Computer even have a positive effect on people across the world. They teach many things for people to learn and that have already learned. Such as, hand eye coordination. When you type up words it teaches you to see better with your eyes. Computers also, give people the ability to see, understand, and gives information about people across the world. Celebraties are very popular on computers or other technologies. Computers help you learn things better than any other technologies. Anything you can get on any other technologies. There is a guarantee of you will find it on your computer. Computers are just like other technologies but in some categories they're much better than the others. Computers are very important in life because without computers we would not learn how to communicate with each other. If we did not have phones to use to call someone. On the computer if you go online you can maybe talk to someone by their email address. You can talk to someone that you have not talk to in years. You can look images or videos that you haven't seen in years. On computers, you can find out information from news that week of or even the day of. In conclusion all I say is that without computers in this world. What would it be like? Most technologies that are not as good computers will be popular without computers. I wonder what it will be like?"
3,"Dear @CAPS1 of society I am writing this letter to you to explain the many benefits towards computers. My first reason will explain the many ways computers help you @CAPS2 believe that people using computers is a very good idea. They believe this because computers make you really focus and pay attention. This gives you really great eye sight and amazing hand eye cor donation. A important ability that computers have is they are able to teach you about far away places depending on were you live. The reason people would probability want to visit one of these places on a website would probability be for vocational purposes. My third reason to why I feel we should keep computers is. There is a lot of websites you can join so that you can speak to your friends as long as there online. IAM, @CAPS3, @CAPS4 excl. These are all great uses for computers. Also people who own a well paying email system on these computer that tells them who wants to sell a piece of machinery, or anything that involves business ethics. Now you know my three very important reasons to why computers are a great way to get hand eye cor donation. A great way to learn about other states. And so you can talk to friends and have a email for business purposes. I hope you have enjoyed reading this and hope to see you on my side toward this topic."
3,"Dear Newspaper, I'm writing to you about the debate that you are having asking if people should use computers. The article stated ""more and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society."" I think people should not use computers. Also technology needs to slow down, it's getting to advanced. My first reason why people need to stop spending time on computers is, you don't want to always say to your on your honeymoon ""we could to @LOCATION1 from our computer. And your life will go by fast and you want notice it, your all fat and old. Also @PERCENT1 of people who use computers are over weight because they don't exercise. Secondly the more technology there is, we are going to have less. In addition it feels better when you work and not just sit on your computer, getting a monthly check. In conclusion you live a happier life when explore the. In @PERCENT2 of people who use computer commit suicide. Also if it was or to me I would the use of computers. Bead all the about computers and you will think but like me. I use to be a computer geek."
3,"Dear news paper I think computers good for you because you can use the internet and MySpace and videos and some school work like math and essays so yes I do think that computers are good for you because you can do all kind of things on computers. And computers can help you with school a lot and you can print out lots of things and why computers can help you is with your math writing spelling and most defiantly is science and ant also literature. The reason why I chose those @NUM1 things is because you can look those @NUM1 things up on. Computer and get the answer to math and spelling right like read @NUM3 helps you write and spell that's one at the reasons why I like computers because I can get on read @NUM3 and I love doing read @NUM3 a lot and I like the read @NUM3 class also because the computers sometimes I like reading on the computers but not all the time but I have to read that's how I'll first learn how to read by for sing my self forward to read. That's how I'll first learned how to read by computers and putting Fosse to my self. That's why computers is more important to me and look words up."
3,"Some people think it is a good idea and same do not. My opinion is that, I think that people spend a lot of time for good reasons. Here are three reasons why, @NUM1. grownups working, @NUM2. students learning how to type, and @NUM3. communicating with others. My first reason is that parents do a lot of work on computer. For example, they do taxes, paperwork, airline tickets, and the bank. And those are usually all done on the computer so it would be easier if people don't drive. My second reason is students need to learn how to type so they can email or even write on paper. It helps them build learning ability and also, so they can know how to sing the @ORGANIZATION1's. Computers are suppose to be fun for people of any age. My last reason is, communicating with others is a great skill to have so you can talk in person. Computers help because if you mess up of what your trying to say then you could just erase what your trying to say. And in person, you can't. Also you can make plans with one of your friend on something if they live really far or something like that. In my opinion. I think people should be able to go on the computers to do work, play games, no sites, and many more other things to go on, only if you have a computer at home."
3,"I believe that computers have good effects on people. Computers allow people to stay in touch with long distance friends or family. Computers have games for kids that help them learn, and, also, people learn new things, too. My first reason is that, computers allow people to stay in touch. If someone in their family live long distance then they could always use emails to talk. That way they wont lose each other. Also, sometimes, friends move away and you always want to keep in touch. Another thing is that, if they want to send photos to each other, they can use email. Also, because, Thur an mail takes forever. Please, let the people stay in touch! My second reason is that, computers has games kids play. The games kids play could help them learn more. Sometimes watching t.v. don't help. If they actually play the game and see what their doing, then they will got smarter. That's what we want for our kids, right? Also, kids have fun playing these games. Do you really want to take the learning experience away? My third reason is, computers help people learn new things. Like, they could go on the computer and learn what's happening in the world. People can learn new words they never knew about. Also, pictures on the computer help, too. For example, if someone is traveling somewhere, and they don't know how the price. They can get on the computer and check it out, right? So, in conclusion, I believe that computers are good use. They help people stay in touch, help kids learn by playing games and help people learn new things about the world and more. So, I'm saying, please, keep the computers. They are not a waste of our time. Turst me!"
3,"Dear Newspaper Computers have been a great learning source and i think it's time we give them some credit ins ted of worrying over them. I will be telling you about how I think computers are great. One reason they are vary helpful is that books dint always have all of the information. So if you need to know a fact or need more information for a project you can go on the computer and it's all right there and you will have known more facts then when you started. The second reason is that you can be almost anywhere and half aces to a computer and you might not have a phone but you can talk or send a message. Not everyone has a phone but computers are a secondary way to have a conversation with someone. Another reason, is its not always sunny outside and when it is a rainy day you have a fun way to play and learn without having to be outside. The computer doesn't replace the outdo res or exercising it is just a pass time when you dint have the opportunity to be outside. I hope you liked and understood my reasons and will take them in to consideration when going over the topic."
3,"I think computers help people out because you can learn about at here thing like @CAPS1 you want a job you can look it up in the computers. Also @CAPS1 you have a problem they will help you out. @CAPS1 you what to go some where you could go and be on the computer and look how it is and @CAPS1 you like it you could go @CAPS1 not look some where else you what to go.

3,"Computers do benefit are society. They have changed the world alto. You can do many things on the internet. On the computer, you can chat with people everywhere. The computer helps the world. These are ways how computers do benefit our society. There are many things you can do on the internet. You can play games with people. You can talk to people on certain websites. You can look up vacation spots. If your tired of being home, then just go on the internet. These are things you can do on the internet. On the computer, there are many settings.

3,"Dear @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 of the @LOCATION1 @CAPS3 I think that computers are a good thing to use. I know that some people do use the computer instead of enjoying a or exercising, but not everyone does that, The computer is a good resource to invest time in. The effects computers have on people is good (for the most part). The statement is true, people that use the computer can talk with people online and get information quickly than the library. I believe that the effects a computer has on a person, are good effects. When people use a computer they can get information which for research and work (word) That's because, when your on a computer you can simply relax but get available amount of work done. You can also do things while your on the computer, hold your dog, hold your cat, eat, drink, text, call. It's very milt propose (use). But some computers is a bad thing because not how the very expensive and same dint have the money to buy a computer but if you do have, you because they're of people or example @CAPS4 cheated and not a computer he could have good so rich and rumors because the computer is what he needs to be successful with Microsoft so computers are useful and the effect they have on people is a positive one."
3,"The use of computers is definitely correct. It is helpful, you can discover new things and much more. Computers makes peoples lives just so much simpler. Computers can help people in magnificent ways by looking for things you desperately need. Like if you were a student and you had to write a paper on @PERSON1. The computer has internet and that like billions of facts @PERSON1 and much more information about every thing. It can be helpful also by looking up the wheat her, the new, even things that are happening around the world and even answering questions you have. Discovering things on the computer is something that happens every day. For example I read an article about the @CAPS1 and the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 the next day my teachers gave us a pop quiz on that and I got @NUM1. If a computer can get some bad a @NUM1 on their test think of what else it could do for the world. It might even help sea lives. Of course a computer can be helpful. In way like cheeking the score from yesterdays game, see whats going on in your community, watch video es, hear music, talk to your friends, relatives get information on places, medical stuff. A computer can basically do every thing from looking up the games scores to saving a life. The use of computers is, obviously the best decision."
3,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 you know how long you go on the computer for? Well get up and go outside. Thats one of my reasons why I think people spend to much time on it my other reason is your eye sit can go bad. Its a nice sunny day dint wast your time on the computer! Go outside! All, kids @CAPS1 is sit on the computer all day not getting exercise. Did you know @NUM1 out of @NUM2 kids that sit on the computers all day gain at least @NUM3? @PERSON1 told me that. I mean I believe him because its true kids dint get up.There missing a nice day out would you wanna miss a nice sunny day? My fin all reason is kids eyesight can go bad. I mean having them stare at a screen all day, that's bad. @PERSON1 told me if your on the computer for @NUM4 hours on the computer for @NUM4 hours straight your eyes can get worst. I remember a tiny when I was on the computer for @NUM4 1/@NUM4 hours my eyes were killing me everything I blink. I know the computer is fun playing games, talking to friends but you should take a break and @CAPS1 something Poles. In conclusion just go outside and have fun! @CAPS1 you want to wast a nice sunny day by staying in doors hurting your eyes? I know I @CAPS1!"
3,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I think computers are good to society, because you can read the news paper online, email your friends and family, and can play games and watch videos or movies. Knowing the latest news is very important, news paper are okay but you have to pay for them with the news paper online you can get the latest news for free! This way you can save money and trees. Heres another way of saving trees. Emailing is a good to talk so some one far away and it's a lot faster than just regular old mailing. Email is also good for emailing links to cool websites, on email can send a funny picture or a video or an important notice. So, Computers can be your news paper and a good and fast way of communication. It also can be useful for entertainment. Computers are one of the most popular entertainment sources. Computers allow you to go on game sites, watch videos or movies or play on online game on just a regular @CAPS1 game. I know whenever I'm bore I go on my computer and I can always find something to don on line or find a movie to watch. So, computers are very popular, in many areas computers are helpful in news, communication, and entertainment. People just need to look at the positive aspects of computers, then they will see how great they are"
3,"I think that the computers are good to be used because anybody can use them at anytime or go on it whenever they want to. The reason why I think it is good is because you can contact someone that you know and talk to them whenever you want. Another reason is because you can play games or look for something or even make a research on stuff that you want to know or about something that you were always curious about. A computer is also use full for better things like using it for when going to work or when a kid in school needs to do a report of project and needs to do it in typing and also to save stuff that you don't want nobody to use. Computers can sometimes be help full to people that really need it and that actually need to use it, but it can also be a fun activity to do if anybody doesn't have nothing to do. I think that the computer is aw some because anybody enough can open up their own website and create something what. A lot of people can go on the internet and open an account on a website; for example a @CAPS1 or a @CAPS2 or a @CAPS3 for that what to have an account. These are a lot of people that use the computer in a good way and use it for things that it can actually be used for. So I think that the computers are Avery help full to people that like searching for stuff that there curious about or to have to use it for good needs."
3,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I am writing to tell you about the effects computers have on people. They teach hand eye coordination, lets people search @CAPS1 places, talk online with people like family and friends. First, the computers teach hand eye coordination it helps you become a better speller and type fast or type without looking at the keys I know it helped me and I'm sure it will help you too. Secondly, computers lets you interact with family and friends and lets you make friends like MySpace you talk to your friends and make @CAPS1 ones Facebook is more mature if you ask me twitter also its just away for you too talk to your friends yahoo, gm ail, AOL. Even teacher es lets the teachers communicate with parents so it helps you communicate without everyone being in your conversation on the phone. Next, it helps you search @CAPS1 and old places like landmarks or businesses like salons, nail parlors. Gyms and @CAPS1 restaurant you can even search when a movie is go in to come out. A computer can help you very much in this type of case. In conclusion computers are good they help you inform you and they can teach you I love my computer it helps me with homework and helps me study. Say you cant talk with someone over the phone, you can email or chat with them and it's so cool/fun and it interesting how you can learn @CAPS1 things it lets you upload pictures, music videos and you can type essays. The computer is very educational."
3,"Dear, news paper I think computers are good, this is because you can learn thing's about faraway places using them, you can also hear about the most recent news and you can communicate with people. In school a lot of the research projects on other places focus on other places around the world. When you use a computer you can read articles about the place and also get pictures and use them in a slide show or photo story. Their are also educational websites that kids can go on to learn their math facts to multiplication tables @CAPS1 the computer is a good learning tool. The computer can keep you updated with the news to! their are news website that post minute to minute things about world news and tell the world what kind of disaster happened in some far away place on the other side of the world. A lot of the time families are spread all over the world, you can chat with family or friend's that have moved by a simple chat room and you can catch up on what has been happening in each other's lives and that's a good tool for family to stay in touch @CAPS1 the computer has lots of benefits that a lot of people all around the world can use, from learning. About a faraway country to chatting with cu son that lives in California and also knowing whats going on in your own home town."
3,"Dear, @ORGANIZATION1, I think computers do have a positive affect on people but I don't think because of computers is the reason people don't exercise or enjoy nature. People make their own choices in life. The computer is just there. If somebody chooses to be on the computer instead of spending time with their family well that's their choice and problem not the computers. Me for example I love working and playing on the computer. Even though I'm on the computer I still do things like talk to my family, I play basketball, and I chill with my homes. Now that's my choice to do all of that. I can easily just sit up in my room and be on the computer all the time. It's nothing wrong with doing that because that is my choice in life. Nobody should be able to tell you to get off the computer because that is your choice in life. If you want to be on the computer instead of going outside that's your choice. Only you know what is best for you."
3,"Dear, @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 name is @CAPS2 @CAPS3 and I am a students in @ORGANIZATION1 middle school. I want to state a opinion on how computer effects people. There are many thing like games, chat rooms, docile thing. Also information for homework or for work and jobs. Well let get started @CAPS1 opinion on people using computer is good, only fools don't use computers. They help you a lot like, let say I am a Cooley and I forgot how to do something, I'll just go on the computer and fine it and it that easy. I use a computer all @CAPS1 life and I am smart, I even help @CAPS1 mom use the computer sometimes.

I talk to @CAPS1 can sen all the time not Reilly a little and he live in Colombia. I also talk to @CAPS1 friends on Facebook to ask what was the homework sometimes. Games, games are fun when you get bored or do not have nothing to do. You can play all different kind of games like action or if you want a chenille's you can play hard games i think games like chess or sedate. To help your brain thank to exercise your Brian. Games can help you knew the computer more like they bored, many people don't even knew how to type with out looking at the broad. I have to look at it. Well thus where same opinion I had about the computer. Even though people think it take time from exercising and interacting with people it not really time. There exercising there Brian and they can interact with people. So till next time"
3,"Dear local newspaper I think that using computers help people because if we did not have computers we would not now hey thing about anyone or anything like all of the @CAPS1 I would not now anything about them but with computers I know alto about them and there lives like @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 got shot in the back of the head and. @CAPS4 got shot to and I know alto about the @ORGANIZATION1 there white people that to fear in to black people and the same with the wars like world @NUM1 and world @NUM2 and the @CAPS5 and @PERSON1 and the @CAPS6 war there was like plain spy plain flying across @LOCATION1 and they shot him down because we were trying to see if thy had ENE nuclear bombs offer there.

3,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion on the effects computers have on people is a positive effect. Three main reasons are that people learn more about cultures, places, and some people work online. @CAPS1 first reason why computers have a positive effect on people is because they help you learn about cultures around the world. Learning about cultures is very important because if people travel they need to know how they can respect each other. @CAPS1 second reason why computers have a positive effect on people is because they help you learn about places around the world the world. Learning about places is very important because you could get lost. It also helps you by telling you which places are famous to visit. @CAPS1 third reason why computers have a positive effect on people is because some people find jobs online. Other people work online. This benefits people in a positive way. In conclusion computers have a positive effect on people because its helps people learn about cultures, places, and jobs around them."
3,"Dear @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, after reading your article about advances in technology, I would like to offer my opinion about this con traversal subject. All around the world, people are using computers to do all sorts of things; weather its for games, the buying and selling of items, talking with people in different countries; the possibilities are endless. This is, however, not necessarily a good thing. Many people become addicted to computers. Esspecialy adolescents, who enjoy the games that computers offer. From personal experience being addicted to computers, I can honestly say that I was under almost complete control by that computer. My grades started to go down, I stopped interacting with my friends and family, and trouble on things. Many parents watch their children go through this and are sometimes helpless to stop it. This poses a large problem for parents. My word of advice; don't let your children become addicted!"
3,"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 you turn there is technology. It's not going to change. Try a schedule. Encouragment helps a lot of people. Activities keep you mind off things read on to find our more. Scheduleing is important. Limit the time on the computer. For every half hour at least @NUM1 minutes outside or with friends. try to memorize the schedule. Encouragement helps me and alto of people! Try to encourage family and friends, The government is also trying to fight this. Encouragement helps. Activities can keep people off the computer. Try neighborhood activities. Afterschool activities for a while. All kinds of stuff is fun. Do you think scheduling helps? Do you like encouragement? Do activities keep you mind off things? then by far this stuff helps."
3,"Dear newspaper editor, I have recently heard that some people think that computers have a negative effect on people. Well i think that computers have a positive effect on people. I think that computers have a positive effect on people because it helps make learning about other countries easier. Also, it helps people talk to people from different countries. Another reason is that it helps people learn about different cultures, religions, or traditions. The reason why some Pope think that computers have a negative effect on people is because people are spending more time on the computer than spending time with their family. Also, people use the computer more than they use exercise machines, bicycles, or scooters. Now that you know about the positive and negative effects of computers, Which side will you choose? the one against computers or the one for computers. I would choose the one for computers."
3,"Dear local newspaper editor, @CAPS1 opinion on the effects of computers on people is that staying on a computer is not that bad it does not rot you brain like video games. are some good reasons why computers are good and help you. Sometimes computers do help with hand eye coordination. You use the computer to do homework or to search a a stores etc. Some computers are really slow but not all of the new ones for @DATE1, computers can also help you read better it has little . You could play talk to people like your friends. Listening to music is an easy thing to you could a website that has all songs that you like to listen yo many people use the computer to find jobs and use it to look for ways to eat right and work out paying bills online is easy er than paying them for real. The computer is easy way to pay and you should agree with @CAPS1 opinion."
3,"Not everyone thinks computers are good for you but they are a very good resource to find information. It's not good to be on the compiler @NUM1 seven but to be on sometimes is not bad. A person who is on the computer all day and does nothing else except that, then that is not healthy at all. People just have to limit their time on how much they stay on the computer. Dont over due it! Computers are also very good for information as I said earlier. If you have a computer or a laptop and you need to find information on something the internet is there. For kids that need to do homework or a project and they need to look up some facts or information on something they could go on the computer for that. It is so much easier to do that then look for books that has all the facts you need. So computers have very good qualities and resources. They rant bad or unhealthy unless if that is your life and that is the only thing you do. That is my opinion on computers."
3,"I think that people are spending a lot of time on there computers and not enjoying nature and things. My reasons are that people don't do anything except surf the web, talk to other people all the time, and they site around eating junk and no exercise. Those are my three reasons. My first reason is people do is surf the web. There is over a million websites to go to. What people do is go to all of them look at things or buy something. The only thing they should be doing is homework or business. Also people play to many video games on the computer too. My second reason is that people go on @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 or use web cams. Those people could be on there for hours talking to people. Sometime those things are peoples life and all they do. I know someone who has a @CAPS1 and after school all they do is talk to people. They have friends on @CAPS1 but no friends in real life. My third reason is when people do go on all they do is eat junk food and get no exercise. Sometimes they eat potato chips and cookies and have soda. If you do that for week you will be very tired and sleepy. Also you can get very fat. Your body will be unhealthy and out of shape. Now that you have read my reasons, I hope you like them. My reasons where people don't do anything but surf the web, talk to other people all the time, and people eat junk food and get no exercise."
3,"Some people @MONTH1 think that computers take up too much time for the important things. But really everything you would like to know is right there. You can learn about nature, cool websites even history. Here are my reasons on the effect on computers. First, you can learn so much about nature online. You can view many types of animals and study them. Learn about plant and the effect they have on life. Also, you can learn about many things on @LOCATION1 and how its changing. Secondly, there are many coll websites you can join. Theres games you can play to keep you occupied during the day. You can even chat online with friends or maybe find long lost friends. School sites are available for students of some studying or help. Lastly, computers show you so much about history. People who things and world famous people from back then compared to famous people now. Most important of all, the life changing story about and how it changes peoples life today. I hope I've you enough to agree with me. As you can see computers have many resources you can learn from learning websites and history aren't even half of them. Think about! Thank you for listening"
3,"Dier: newspaper I think the computers are beneficial and consequential. Computers are beneficial because thy entertainment, informational and super yous fall., I in joy all the cool video on YouTube while older people mite wash the news.

3,"To whom it @MONTH1 concern, I feel that computers are a great in most people lives. One you can use them for almost everything. two computers are good for you in many ways. It shouldn't affect Daley schedule or just being with your family. People can use computers for almost everything for one their are hundred of websites on the computer. For example, you can play games all different kinds, you can also chat with people, lit sen to music, watch videos, look for places and a whole lot more. Computers are very useful in many different ways. Computers are also good for you. They help with you eye coordination. You can also go online and do practice on math, social studies, etc. The internet also has a lot of educating games whiten is good for people who had that extra help. It also helps you with you hand coordinations because on the computer you need to know how to type. you get relay good at it you can type without looking. A computer can not get between you Daley schedule or way u do with your family. Because a computer is a computer you go on it if you need something or you go on it just for fun for example i have computer at my house and someone goes on it everyday and it never affect what everybody does us kids still go to school my parents still go to work, we eat dinner together we do what we have to do, and the computer never gets in the way. As my conclusion i know that computers are good to have in peoples houses. One you can use them for almost everything. Two computers are good for you. Three i shouldn't affect your daily schedule in anyway."
3,"Dear newspaper people I think computers are good because Watt if I have a family member that goes out of town and you want to stay in touch and I dint have a phone then I can goon a chatting web sight and stay in with them. When @CAPS1 bored I go on Google to look up and pic hers and play some games. You can look up one think and find something Elsa, but it will Czech your eyes. Computers are good were ever you go, it can look up for a project for school. Bur ween you are in school it can help you with spelling, and if u got to know Watt con trey has the most people the @CAPS2 will find the once as fast as a snap. Computers are advancing every year. Seart the @CAPS2 was just a screen and a mouse, now we got laptops that you can tack every were. People can get exercise if thy want and thy can enjoy nature thy can bring a laptop. But when you are exerciseing then you can go right to YouTube and Lisbon to some mu sick and watch funny videos. And that's way I think computers are good."
3,"Dear @CITY1 current I am writing to you on the issue about people spending to much time on computers and not able to spend time with other people like family, friends and others. Also people are getting information off of the computer which is a good thing for important paper that you might have to do or collage essay to get in to that collage. Another reason is that people are training a bit lazy and not getting to enjoy exercising and getting to get some fresh air. To more on I will explain what I mean about being with family and friends. For example let's say that your friends are planing on going to his huge beach party that every one is going to. So you tell your friends to pick you up but before they come you go on the computer talk to some you know and your friends come to your house to pick you up but you are not  for them they pass on by you don't go go to school next day there talking about you miss the party. SO that is any story , it might seen long so, I'm shorting the next part which is the information on computer. Foe example lets say that you  doing on  paper you  . Just need you re more . You find a place you go on find good write come down yet of of the computer finish paper get grade that is good feel happy the end. So that is the only good end of the reason why computers are good. For some  reason some people went to stay inside on the computer but other go outside on a good warm day. So what is your reason MySpace, Facebook other its good if you talk to other people bad if all you worried about if your pics are good, what matters is there you need to be Harpy. I think  done all I could. So theses are my reason why computer are good and bad  for reach bad because of nodding to exercise and need to be with friends "
3,"I believe computers are a benefit to society. Computers help hand eye coordination they make it easy to learn about different places and allow people to talk and video chat. Computers teach hand eye coordination when typing and eventually you get so good you dint ever have to look down at the keyboard. you can search for anything on the internet and if you want to learn about a country you can search it and find out all new things you never knew before. Maybe you want to go on vacation to another country and can't decide which country to go to you can go on the computer and look up tourist attractions in those country's to decide which are you want to go to. If you are on vacation or live in a different place from you and want to see them you can video chat with them over the computer. Those are the reasons why I think that computers are a benefit to our society."
3,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you think computer's are good to use? More and more people use computer, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society I sarong disagree. My first reason is because computer's are not safe. My second reason is computer's could get you in a lot of trouble. My @CAPS3 reason is you never know what could happen on the computer. Read on and see why I disagree. First @CAPS4 gonna tell you why I disagree. The reason why I disagree is because computer's are not safe because you could have someone trace where you live at then what? Second  computer's could get you into a lot of tribe such as posting things online or saying mean thing's to people. Next computer's are bad because if someone like's you and you say I dint like you they could post mean and hurt full thing's and then if you friend's see it you will probably get mad. Finally  in concussion these are all my reason's why I think computer's are not good. You never know what COD happen on a computer there's website's there and some could start a virus on your computer. Also I think computer's are not good because computer's lead to no good so keep your child away from computers. Also be careful what Chi @CAPS2."
3,"Over one million people on the computer daily. I think being on the computer is unhealthy. So many people abuse themselves staying on to long. You should manage a time schedule so you can still get exercises dint use the computer if needed. People become overweight also. I think people should do something Elsa then use the computer. One main effect that see is many people play the computer too long and are becoming overweight. This can be stopped if we all join together. One person isn't going to change anything. But many of us will. We can be the huge dangerous pr editors going for the prey. If there is something Elsa to do besides play the computer do it. If you know your over weight from the computer. You!! Can make a change. If you keep doing other activities you can get skinny again easily. You just gotten make that type of change. A serious issue is people don't wanna take time to make a quick little chart to manage computer use age. The way see it is if we make a chart then we will know when to get off and tween to play. This is important because some people take in information better when they have it in front of them. This could make some satisfying results. People use the computer for school work. This is good depending on how long it takes. In my opinion people shouldn't be on the computer or more then @NUM1 hours to @NUM2 hours a day. I think people should get their schoolwork done and get off. I much rather see kids outside playing. The nature and wildlife is much more important. The effects on the computer puts on us can vary. If its not to overweight to not spending time with families, to doing schoolwork. You need to use your time wisely."
3,"Dear, Local Newspaper writer I believe that computers benefit our society because we could connect to people more faster and easier. And computers @CAPS1 good for our society because of we don't have to spend to much time on the phone. That @CAPS1 why I think computers benefits our society. ""@CAPS1 computers a good thing or bad thing?"" Computers are a good thing because you could email your family or friends any time you want too. But sometimes we don't have to be on the computer so long. That @CAPS1 why I think computers are a good thing. Without computers it will be different because you have to talk to people on the phone or text message. In my opinion I am really thankful that we have computers. And on computers you could go on everything like @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and even work on the computer. That @CAPS1 without computers it will be different. I think people are not spending to much time on the computer"", because a lot of people on the computer to do office work. Computer make things a lot easier for us! But sometimes people take advantage over it. That @CAPS1 why I feel people are not spending too much time on the computer. Last but not least that @CAPS1 why I know computers benefit's our society."
3,"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I am writing a letter to you saying that I think its a bad idea for you to make kids stay off of computers because it does teach kids something, it good to do homework on and you can relax when your on it. Well computers teaches kids a loaf of things like hand eye coordination. If kids want to work with computers when there older they can learn new to work with it. There is also websites that can show you how to move your hands when using a computer. Well when kids come from school always have homework, @CAPS2 you need to do it on the computer so if you couldn't use computers it would be hard for kids to do there homework. So when they go to school and the class tells the teacher they dint have computers what are they going to do. So when I get out of school and I had a very long day. I go home do my homework and go on the computer and listen to music to relax. If you guy were to take computers away every one would be grumpy all the time. That is why I think you should keep computers and not exercise as much. We get Enif of that in school carry all these Harvey books around."
3,"I think computers are good because if you need to remember stuff all you have to do is just look at there Emil and they will remember what thy have to do and also it is good if you is lost all you have to do is look at the map quickly. if you need to finish a school project you could do it in the computer looking for the web sit of the project, if you need to cheek a web sit about anything in portent you could just tip the web sit down and it will show up on the computer and if your child don't have nothing to do they could play games in clouding math games, @CAPS1 games, and also thy could look for Nick Nick jocks."
3,"Dear, @LOCATION1 @CAPS1 I think the use of computers are good, here are some reasons why? My first reason is you can find stuff online. My second reason is you can have fun. My last reason is you can make @LOCATION1 friends. I will write @NUM1 paragraphs explaining my reasons. Going back to my introduction my first reason was you can find stuff online. If you can't find a job you can go online and find some. If you want to go to college but you have no time you can take classes online. Those are my details to support my reason. My second reason was the computers are so fun. To me they are fun because when you are bored you can play games. If you are not a game person you can play serves. Or you can find out facts. That how I can back up my second reason. My third reason was you can meet @LOCATION1 people. You can meet @LOCATION1 people be search them up if you are trying to find a old friend. Or there is social networking such as MySpace, Facebook's, twitter etc which you can meet @LOCATION1 people. Mostly everyone would like to meet @LOCATION1 people. To end this story my @NUM2 reason was yo can find stuff online, my second reason was you can have fun. My last reason was you can meet @LOCATION1 people."
3,"Dear @CAPS1, Computers can have a positive effect or a negative effect on people. It all depends on how you loOK at it and what type of person you are. You can say computers have a very positive effect on people or say computers have a very negative effect on people. My opinion is that computers have a positive effect on people but you can't say that I am just a kid and she plays on it all the time. Well that is true however, it can teach you hand eye coordination. For @CAPS2 what I am doing right now is learning to type faster and faster. Another @CAPS2 is some people are faster at typing than writing but some people write faster than type. Me personally am faster at than writing. My final reason is after a hard day at school or work you can come home, play some music and relax. It is a good idea to learn how to type fast so if you are let's say writing a story for school. You just started the story and it is due tomorrow. What are you going to do well if you stared to type when you were younger by the time you are in the middle school you could type really fast. That way you could finish your story in time. This means you should learn haw to type faster. Some people prefer to write than type but other people prefer to type than write. I personally prefer to type than write but that is just me. Let's say a friend of mine like to write more than type that is OK. We will not be not friends after that we will just like the same thing that is all. This means some people prefer to write than type. This probably happens after a hard day at school or work you can come home use the computer to play some music and relax. You can play all the music you want. As well as do other things as well as the same time. For @CAPS2, I play music and talk to my friends at the same time. I @CAPS3 use it to do homework. In conclusion, it is a good idea to keep computers to use. People can still enjoy nature as well as computers at the same time. Over all computers have a positive effect on people."
3,"Dear local @CAPS1 I hear you are not sure if computers are good or not well they are and I have many reasons why but I will tell you is. First the games teach hand eye coordination, teach people about faraway places like other country's, last it helps to keep in touch with people. My first major reason is it can and does help hand eye coordination every day. It does this with the mouse you have to be very coordinated to be good at the games on the computer. This will help in every day lives to to play catch with your son or to pick something up it is very important. Also it can help you get on ethnic back round to learn about faraway places. If you are going on a trip I would want to know about that place to see what I need. Or to just look at how beautiful the country's are will make you amazed. So for just @NUM1 reasons I would already rethink. Finally I think this is most important reason of to stay in touch with I know my mom dint got a Facebook and she talking to all he old friends she says ""nice"" I think have friends is very important to everyone and computers help them. I conclusion there are reasons why a computer is good like hand eye co ordinations learning about faraway places. So I hope you have been I know I would have and there is no doubt is my you will make the right choice."
3,"Dear @CAPS1, Experts agree that people go outs ide and exercising because their are three reason why people should go outs ide and there are: people don't have a lot of exercising, they can hang out with their friend and family, and people and kid should enjoying the outs id nature. Let me explain, people and kids these days do have alto of exercising. People who don't exercising can gran weight if they don't exercising at all. Also, parents and kids who spend all day on their computer or laptop can be over weight. Kids these day, have hard time to exercising because there are over weight by stay ing on their computer and play their computer game. Wouldn't you agree the kids and adults can hang out with there Friend and family. Kids need to stop going on the computer and go outs ide more offing with their friend or family. You might want to consider that parent need to spend time with there friend and family then stay ing on the computer at home. Don't you think that people should go outs ide and enjoying the nature. Amazingly, people know what nature is but the don't know what the true meaning of nature is! Adult should spend time by going outs ide then stay in at their house because @PERCENT1 of the world dint have computer at all."
3,"Dear @CAPS1, I think that computer are a waste of time, but they Al'so help you in many ways. You should only go on the computer if you reALly have too. Peple are on the computer for hours at a time, they go on the computer if they are bored or if they don't want to go outside. People have made the computer duster and more effective. So more and more people buy computers each year. Computers Al's helps you in AL of ways, you can learn from a computer, you can find a job on the computer, and you can Al'so shop on the computer. So if you need to find a job then you can go on the computer and find a job that is right for you. You can learn from the computer. The computer can give you so much information it is unbelievable, you can look up anything and even ask questions. Last, you can shop on the computer. Say you can find something in a store and you looked everywhere so you go home and you can go on the computer and find what you are looking for. But, you most likely are going to need a credit card. So this is why I think computer are helpful but a waste of time."
3,"Dear @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1, I personally disagree with the experts who are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. The reason why I disagree is because it not the computers flt people don't get out and exercise. Buying a computer and getting on the computer is free will and the computer dosen't you get on it that's our choice so we can't blame the computer for people not exercising. Another important thing to remember is that computers are important is because they help you get more educated. For example there are computer class online for people that want to there degree in different fields, with just a click of a button you it can change you future and career for the rest of you life. The most important reason is because it help people learn about different cultures and ways of life. I love learning about @LOCATION1 and @LOCATION2 even through they had that terrible storm. I thank you for listening to my opinion and I hope that it change's your point of living a life without computers"
4,"Dear local news paper, In @CAPS1 op pinion I think Thait those who makes computers should make up an Times added to the computers. There should be a law Thait people has to go out and exercise before and after then use computers finally, I think Thait children should use the computer less Thain the adult fee health reasons. @CAPS1 first op pinion Thait I think Thait those who makes computers should make Timers added to the computers to Time Thai amount of Tim people should take depending on what they are doing like when some one is play ing a game they spend hours play in instead of doing a diff rent activity. Also like when a person is doing their home work they start getting carried away in taking their Time going slow and ends up finishing very bad. @CAPS1 second op pinion Thait I think Thait those who makes computers should have a law Thait people has to go out and exercise before and after they use computer becausee there is a big percentage amount of people who are ob east becausee everyone sits in the sits in the computers and starts to eat while they are play ing games and watching videos for hours and they dint take a break to go outside and @CAPS1 third and final op pinion Thait I think Thait those who makes computers should have children use the computer less Thain the adults for health reason's becausee kids are always looking at the computers an their eyes are always getting red and then they start to not being able to see as well as they used to then they end up having to need glasses or abettor prescription glasses. Also because kids are usually going into chatting sites and they start to talk to people who they dint know so they end up getting raped or kidnapped by the person Thait they went to talked to for hours. So local news paper will you make Thait change for the society and for the children? Because I would!"
4,"Dear Local Newspaper, I believe that people should stay with computers. I have three reasons for this issue and they are @CAPS1, @CAPS2 and @CAPS3. I think these reasons woul'd be a good for this issue because every human being can do these three this on a computer. One of the reasons why I think people should stay to computers is because they can learn. People can learn by using computers because if a child is in something like animals. They can go on the internet and look up what they need to find children can also learn on the computer by putting their jump stat first grade give in the drive. children can learn like this. My second reason why people should use stay to computers us @CAPS2. I think @CAPS2 because you can talk to your friends about. They can also talk about if they want to go some fun. For example same good exercise. Another reason why I think @CAPS2 is if your friend is explaining something to you, that your. I also think @CAPS2 can be had for other to a and. The last reason why I believe people should stick to computer is because people can discover different things on there these things can be had and some can be good. For example a good thing that I can discover is that if there is something wrong with my computer and I figure out how to fix this that would be good. And I will know about computers and man what to do. A bad thing about @CAPS3 the computer I can do is bringing up a virus. That know matter what I do I can't make it go away and the computer ends up being broken. Conclusion, Local newspaper this is why I believe that we should keep our computers. Because many people even young children can learn and they will end up remembering the things that they learn."
4,"Dear town of sou thing ton, Computers our town are very important for instance. For all of the banks we have computers and for almost every job. We need computers for life, and that doesn'@CAPS1 make use lazy and forget full it makes us busy. The only situation with someone who is online being lazy is with a teenager playing games. But the only reason some kids do that is because they all dint want to go and exercise or run around with their family who they see everyday. But because they want to talk to their friends make plans and just talk while they play together. If someone is ignoring their family or becoming more lazy, it is because that is their choice to sit around and do nothing. And I do agree that people are becoming over weight but I think that is because some people consider a workout to be an hour of lifting and running once a week. And that isn'@CAPS1 right. I think that this news paper should post up adds about gyms and maybe that will lower the fatty meter in our town. or if they think people are neglecting their families have people work less so they can go home and see their families. As for teens I think you parents out there need to set some rules like @NUM1 hours of play a day, @NUM2 hours on a @DATE1, and if they don'@CAPS1 listen take the game away for a day of two, but that might not get them to spend time with you because they @MONTH1 be mad, but it will get them outside or at least doing something more active and not watching @CAPS1.V. or playing video games all day. Also I know this from experience because I am a tanager and I always go outside and run around when my parents take my games away, and it's @PERSON1 that of home world. Please take my advise and your happy caring family will always stay together and active and not always sitting on the computer stressing over work and playing videos games."
4,"Dear newspaper and readers of @LOCATION1, I am @PERSON1, a student from @ORGANIZATION1, I have recently been en formed about the argument over computer use and I feel it is silly. We need computers in life to help us do jobs, communicate with family or friends traveling the world, and for research on homework. First of all, without computers many people would struggle. My father uses a computer for his job and he couldn't do his job without one. Sure, many people spend way to much time on their computer, but other people use it to save information or find research. I know people argue that computers should be used less, but could you get through a week without using one computer? Most people couldn't, especially if you own a business. In addition, from using computers for jobs, some people like to chat online with a friend that move away. Imagine if your family member or friend traveled constantly and they went to places where they couldn't get connection on their cell phone, the only way to talk to them is charting through the web. I'm sure everyone has used a computer once to talk to a friend or for something related to business, so they are more useful than people realize. Lastly, as a kid we need to be able to use a computer, not just to talk to friends but for homework. Some homework requires us to make PowerPoint's, write a paper on historical facts, and we need computers to do so. Without computers, kids wouldn't be able to gather facts or information to write a paper. Decreasing computer use for kids can potentially bring down their grades. My teacher always says, ""grades are the most important thing."" I'm sure all parents would agree with that. All in all, we can't decrease the use of computers because it can do damage to peoples lives. Think about people who travel alto, kids with work that needs to be done, and parents with jobs that they need computers for, don't upset all of these people by decreasing computer time. Thank you for your time,"

4,"In my opinion I think that computers have a good affect on people. I think this because about millions of people use computers everyday! The affects on them are that people get learn things easier. There are millions of a job sites that would have to do with something of learning. About @NUM1 of collage students go online and do challenge. If you were a collage student and did collage online you would: see your family more won't be a hassle to get to collage and would be easier to concentrate being by your self and learning. Also they even make stone which is very popular learning a different language and where you learn this from is on a computer. My second reason is to talk on the . About @NUM2 of our daily! Online phone you and you can also the cool them even more that have you talk to give . I know have a Facebook give don't get think it would be a good chore. up free. So in conclusion I think that there good effects on people that use CPU. Also when everyone that uses their CPU they still enjoy the nature talk to their family . So if you don't have a CPU you get one and will do other fun stuff you like."
4,"Dear Local Newspaper @CAPS1, I am against that computers benefit society in anyway. Yes computers are a great way to learn about things all over the world, but people have to worry about what is right in front of them. Being on the computer all the time gives less time of exercising, no sight of enjoying nature, and gives less time of interacting with family and friends. Computers don't benefit everyone because it gives less time of exercising. When people don't exercise because they are busy always doing something else less important, then you would always be tired. You won't want to do anything but just sit around & do nothing which calls for laziness you would go weak without exercise. You wouldn't have the strength to eat or lift anything which calls for your bone to go weak and you wouldn't get the calories & calcium & vitamins that your body needs to be strong. You would gain weight which calls for you being out of shape. Since your body has no exercise the weight & fat just stays. Being on the computer doesn't help you enjoy nature the way that you are supposed to. You will never see the world for what it is. You will always miss out on fun activities, then when people start talking about how much fun they had you're going to wish you were there. And you will always be stuck in the house which is going to get boring & there's nothing fun to do. If you're always on the computer cell the time you will never interact with family & friends. That is mostly & always more important than computers because they are always always going to be there for you. You will miss out on fun important occasions with your family because you're so addicted to the computer. And your friends will stop being with you because you're not hanging out with them. Computers really don't benefit everyday people because you miss out on the greater things of life. You will miss out on exercising, nature and especially family and friends. Then you are going to wish that you had spent time with them instead of the computer because you are going to see they had a great time & you would want a great time too!"
4,"Dear @CAPS1 Newspaper, @CAPS2 you know what computers are doing to the people of the @LOCATION1? Well I @CAPS2. People are on the @NUM1. We need to @CAPS2 something about these computers. They are preventing people from exercising, going outside, are are just making them stay in there house all day. One reason I think we should get rid of computers is because people aren't getting there exercise. the computer, next to the @LOCATION2, is probably the number one thing that makes people fat. Kids are sometimes on the computer all day eating snacks and junk food when they should be eating healthy fruits and vegetables. You could. Almost @CAPS2 anything on the computer that you @CAPS2 in your everyday life, that's how good technology is. The computer is the thing that gets people addicted to something. The computer has games, internet, and ways to talk to people that get then attached. A second reason is that computers just keep taking money out of your pocket. When you buy a computer most people just buy the most expensive one, because the salesman talks then into it. Most people don't know what kind of computer they are supposed to buy, so they buy the most expensive one because they think the more, the better. Also just buying the computer isn't all of it. When you download soft wares, games, and Mobile things that all cost money. Downloading one thing can cost up to one hundred dollars. plus, most people can't afford these downloads after buying themselves a pr icy computer. My third opinion is that the computer is just a complete waist of time. People spend hours on the computer doing stupid stuff, like playing games and talking to the, when they should all be outside enjoying the fresh air. Going outside is very important to your health. Next time your on the computer doing something that doesn't need to be done, go outside. Think about it, hour often @CAPS2 you go outside? My guess, not much. Now @CAPS2 you know what computers are doing to the people of the @LOCATION1? They are making people fat, not getting there exercise, eating junk food and play games all day long on this stupid piece of technology. Instead of being on the computer all day why don't you think about going air you need. Also you don't want to be wasting all of your hard worked money on a stupid piece of technology. Plus, you don't want to deal with soft wares and there viruses. My advice, computers are terrible."
4,"I believe that computers benefit society and help people understand things more clearly. Computers help people study, learn, and even talk to other people. Here are some good reasons on why computers help people out with problems. First of all, computers give you information on things that you cannot find in books. People can look up places for vacations, what their child's grade in school is, and find healthy food recipes. Without the computers people would be lost not knowing what to do. Next, computers let you talk to friends. You can discuss things like weather, ideas you have, you can even plan exercise days. What if something important happens? The person does not have his or hers phone. What could they do? They could go on the computer and tell their friend. It would be a lot easier than driving over to the persons house then driving driving all the way back. Finally, computers can give you a good sense of hand eye coordination. Computers can teach you how to type without even looking at the keyboard. This skill could be used to pursue a good career in the carpentry field. Computers can also help you study for a new job and what the requirements are. In conclusion, I believe that computers make peoples a little bit easier knowing that they have vital information right at the tips of their fingers. It can also help them in anything they want to do. Like talk to friends, look up info and teach skills."
4,"To whom it @MONTH1 concern, @CAPS1 more people are getting involved with using the computer while I think that is great other don't. I believe that using a computer is a good thing because technology is going to progress and computers will be the base, also computers are safer now because or privacy options and virus block. Finally, computers help you gather knowledge that no one book could tell you. Although technology is progressing computers are only the basics. Sooner or later everything will be based on computers like, jobs, school, and ever the medical field. Jobs will have more computers and touch screen devises because they are easier and more technological advanced. As for school @CAPS1 students have to take computer classes to learn how to write brochures and make websites. The medical field is now using more advanced ultrasounds that take the image and make it there dimensional. So, if everything is changing around you why do you want to be stick in the past? Although, some people are worried about internet safety and viruses, there are ways that those can be limited. As for social networking sites don't set it up for the whole world to see. Set it up for only your friends to see. Also, make sure you know who your friends are. As for viruses, don't go on websites that cause viruses. Also, you can get a virus blocker that helps eliminate them. The computer also helps to give you and get you knowledge. You can learn about coherent civilizations. Or modern day without taking a step out of your house. Also the internet has virtual simulations so you can experience what it was like in other cultures, in other time Pericles. Computers give you knowledge that help you through your life especially if you don't have a library. Even though some people disagree computers are the base of technology, safe, and full of knowledge I do. Yes, they do have some flaws but they are a great learning tool."
4,"Dear Newspaper, Some people are asking others about the effects computers have on other people. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computer and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. But my opinion is that the co muter is great and it does not keep people away from other activity's. First, the computer does not keep people away from other activity's because, there are @NUM1 hours in a day, and it's that persons flt if they don't get off the computer, and go do other activity's. Even though the computer has lots of things, and it is very interesting. people. Should still have the common since to get off and go do other things, so I think it's there fault if they don't get off the computer. Also there are a lot of reasons that people don't get out and do other activity's, so why just stop computers. Secondly, the computer does not keep people away from other activity's, because there are lots of destruction that keep people away from other activity's, so why blame computers. For example the television keeps people from doing other activity's, but their not talking about stop that. Also the computer teaches you about a lot of thongs, an can so you a lot of things that you don't know about and is trying to find out. For example your family's history, you could go look that up on the computer. Lastly, the computer does not keep people away from other activity's, because if people were really worried about there other activity's then they would get off the computer and go do what they had to do. For example if they had to go to the gym then they should get off the computer, and go to the gym because the computer does not make you fat, you make yourself fat, so the should be reasonable enough to go to the gym, and not be on the computer all day. Also if you were going to spend time with your family the how could the computer stop you from doing that, you should already know what you need to do and I don't think the computer would make you forget things like that. So it would be the person's fault if they forget not the computers. To rap this up, computers does not keep people away from other activity's, because it's there responsibility to remember what they need to do not the computers and there are lots more destructions then computers, but it's still not computer's faulty it your's."
4,"Dear @CAPS1, I think computers have a positive effect on people because it will help you with interacting, learning and coordination. By interacting with people like far away friends or unknown Fred's. If they are far its a nice way to send photos back and forth to see how the person/people are doing. Family is a very important factor in computers because if you ha vent seen the person you can tell how they are progressing in life. If that's not the case you can meet new people. By meeting new people you have more connections in your life and more people to trust. Learning! Learning is a good thing for adults an children. Computers can teach children by showing them new words, colors shapes and sizes. For an adult it can show them meanings of words or new words. Words, colors and sizes can all be round on a computer all by learning. A computer can not only do mental things to affect you also physical like coordination. You can improve your coordination by making you stronger when you type. Your hands are a big thing in like and they are helpful in a lot of ways. By sitting up straight in your computer chair all day can improve your posture. Your back can get straighter from all time you are sitting. Your mind can be focused and in one pot focusing on thing is good for you such as the computer screen. Now, people can think that computers are good for you too. But there could be negative ideas for people who think the opposite way."
4,"Dear Local Newspaper, I think computers have both good and bad effects on people. Some people just sit around all day playing games and being lazy. Other people actually use their computers for things that they need. Also some people need their computers for their jobs. I do agree that some people who spend all day in front of their computers are spending less time exercising! Would you rather play games all day instead of spending some quality time with your family and friends? Not me, I would much rather be with friends outside or having a family picnic at a park or lake. For other people though, the story is much different. Some people need computers and other advances in technology for their everyday life. A lot of jobs today require you to use a computer, for example working at a bank you use computers all day! I also think students rely on computers to do work too. A lot of students type up reports and other things for school on their computers. Students also use computers to look up information. The internet can be a very good source for students. I know for me, the internet has come in handy for school projects, or maybe something as simple as just looking up a word. I can also see why people dint really care about adv aces in technology or computers! Some people dint need them for anything, and some are probably thinking people are on them way too much. To me, I honestly find computers useful because I can talk online to my family in @LOCATION1. I hope you liked my opinion about computers, remember, they are useful to some people, but not all."
4,"Dear Newspaper, In think that computers are not good for the society. There are three reasons why I think this and these are the following; @CAPS1, people don't get to spend time with their family. Second, you can get misspell words using instant messenger. When your doing your homework you can get dist rated by the computer. The @CAPS1 reason why computers are bad for the society is because people don't spend enough time with their family, I know I don't. I spend at least half my day staring at a screen when I could be outside walking my dog with friends. Furthermore, instant messenger is the most addicting. When I type something, I use abbreviations for any word. The professor at @LOCATION1 says at least @PERCENT1 students spell abbreviated words in tests. For example, if you wanted to spell ""what"" instead the @PERCENT1 would spell ""@CAPS2"". Finally, my last reason why I think computers are not good for society is because you can get distracted by it a lot. I know that because I am driven to the world of computers. When ever I do my homework. I can't keep my eyes off the screen. Therefore explains that computers are not good for society. In conclusion, computers keep you from spending time with your family, has students misspelling words, and distracting you from doing your homework. I hope you agree with me on this."
4,"Dear @CAPS1, I strongly believe computers have positive effects on people and the society. My reasons are you can learn and find new information on anything, you are able to talk to people faraway and computers teach skills to use in the future. I will now like to elaborate my reasons further. First of all, going on the internet and search sites help you learn and find information on anything you want. On the internet you can even ask questions, and they will probably be answered. You my even use information on the computer for a report statistics show @PERCENT1 of people who do reports, find their facts on the internet. Google, yahoo, and other search sites have helped children become more int rested in learning. Also, using a computer bales you to talk to other people from faraway places or friends you have not seen in a while. You can even web cam with people. I remember a few weeks ago, my best friend moved to Florida, and now we web chat everyday! Talking online will even lower your telephone bills. Chatting online doesn't lost anything, where as the telephone charges for out of country calls cost . Computers will let you talk with your best buddy and save money. Last but not least, computers teach skills that can be applied later in life. Today many jobs in due using a computer, and technology is getting mom advanced. Before you know it will have to know how to work a computer. Also, you probably will need a computer in college. Proffesor @CAPS2 even stated, ""every single kid in my courses have some sort of computer."" In college you will take notes and do assignments. Using computers will help you do this and make your life easier. As you can see i believe computers help people and society greatly. My reasons are you can learn and find information on anything, you are able to talk to other people who are faraway, and computer skills will help you in life. Technology is advancing and were going to have to use a computer sooner or later."
4,"Dear Local Newspaper @CAPS1, Are computers really as great as they seem? It seems to me that they are used way too much in people's lives, and that computers are DIstractions that don't allow people to DI certain things in their life that they would if they weren't always on the computer. People's lives are starting to revolve around going on the computer, checking your Facebook, and looking at new videos on @CAPS2.com. I know from experience Facebook or MySpace can be very adDIcting. I'll spend hours commenting on pictures or new wall posts, and then at @NUM1 pm I've realized I haven't begun any of my loads of homework. This happens quite often, and I end up staying awake until around @NUM2. The following miring I wake up at @NUM3 am, exhausted. I am not exaggerating either, this happens to many of my friends, and if you have kids, ask them because I am @PERCENT1 sure they are on Facebook or @CAPS3 all night. This doesn't just happen with kids either, my mom just got a Facebook and she is hooked to it, even more than I am. Sometimes it can be come a competition to see who has the most pictures, or the most friends. Kids start adDIng people as friends that they don't even know computers aren't just DIstractions, they are also very dangerous. At my school we had assembly where they showed us how easy it was to find out someone's personal information, Even if you don't have your address or your phone number listed, there are many other ways to track you down. If you take a picture right after you won the championship soccer game, in your jersey. Just that one picture shows your team name, your last name, and your number. Anyone could easily search all that stuff on the internet and know exactly where your next game be. As the local newspaper @CAPS1, I am sure you must be concerned about the safety of the town, or even your own kids. Some people @MONTH1 say ""that would never happen to me"" but it easily could, especially if you're constantly on your computer. I have noticed that a lot of teens around my age are starting to become obsessed with being on the computer. A lot of times in families, instead of spenDIng time together. siblings are fighting over who gets to go on the computer. One sibling @MONTH1 need it for homework, while the other just wants to talk to her friends on @CAPS3 and each believes they deserves the computer. Computers are starting to interest a lot with people's lives, in a negative way. Once again they are DIstracting, dangerous and hurt families. Computers hurt society more than it helps. And maybe you should look into how much time your kids are spenDIng on the computer. "
4,"Dear local newspaper, I disagree because it would give kids, children to do negative thing like being rude, not listening, being loud, not doing homework just because your on the computers. Please listen to why I disagree here are some reason why. I know when i am on the computer my mom every @NUM1 Min's what you own because there nasty things on that computers that kids, children be looking at you never now they could learn how to kill someone just being on the computer. I know when I go on that computer I am rude and disrespectful because when I am on you can tell me nothing because I was into the computer my attention move to the computer. Thats why they should have @CAPS1 computers because it takes the attention. I don't listen while I am on the computer my mom tell's me to get on "" I will say ""@CAPS1"" I am doing some thing she will tell me to get off i @CAPS1 leave me alone because I am on the computer and because I am focus on the computer. And I have the computer loud so @CAPS1 one could get my attention so I have the computer all ways loud because my main focus was the computer than I'll do whatever later. O and I don't even remember what be hap pend when I get on the computer. Not doing your school. I know I be telling my mom let me use the computer so I could do my school work and I be getting on different things instead f doing my homework my mom be like t through you were doing you homework and say ""I did finish my homework when I know I did not finish my homework but I only say it because my focus was on the computer. These are reason why the society should take back the computer. I hope you understand the reasons I give you because the society should really stop giving out the computers in the first place. If you have a daughter or a son and know they have said some of these things now you know you children have been and always lied to you. Know I could only the computer for @NUM2 min each day. So yes take them away."
4,"Dear local newspaper committee...., I am writing to you, about how there is a substantial dilemma within the concern of computer use. From my data that I have collected, computers are both somewhat good, and bad. But I believe that there are more reasonable ""@CAPS1,"" toward computer use. In my opinion, I state that computers are quite addicting due to, addiction of computer, loss time of exercise, and how computers @MONTH1 ""help,"" one in obtaining the loss of their social endowment. Computer @MONTH1 seem helpful but of @ORGANIZATION1 they are a great way to research for @ORGANIZATION1 reasons. But there is also the choice of books for research. Computer use has risen to a substantial crisis line, because they are addicting. An example is the well known link called, ""@CAPS2,"" @CAPS2 is a place where you can socialize. But when your child has a @CAPS2, and they are on the computer doing ""homework,"" there is a @PERCENT1 that they will end upon @CAPS2, than rather doing their homework that important information was found at an @ORGANIZATION1 @DATE1. Computers are addicting also because of online computer games. Computer games online can be fun, but are a complete waste of time for you electrical bill, and @ORGANIZATION1 purposed of you child. Computers are very addicting in terms of @CAPS2, and online games. Computers are somewhat good, but are very to you health. Did you know that @PERCENT2 of @LOCATION1 has increased their weight, due to video games and computer? Computers are horrible when it comes to this topic. Overtime, you begin to gain weight by spending more time using the computer and less time working out and staying fit. This also revolves around addiction, by using the computer over a large period of time. In the end, computers are a hazardous topic, when it comes to working out, and staying in shape. Computers are terrible and horrified when it comes to friends. Friends are people who spend time with you and interact with you. But computers see it a different way. by using computer for a long period of time, you begin to think how computers are all you need. Soon enough, your friends will leave you because you don't care about them, and forget them. This also revolves around addiction. By addiction, you lose your friends and you damage your social environment. Computer @MONTH1 seem ""fun,"" but are defoliated when it comes to friends. In the end, I believe that computers are a waste, because they are addicting you become very unhealthy and they strive to damage your social environment. With the facts I have stated, they have supported my reasons. Computers are not the way to go. So, try books."
4,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Computers are a vital source for anyone's household. Many people have busy lives and having a computer at home make it easier. You can use it for research, organization, and business matters. I dint know what I would do without one. Education is very important especially in our economy today. The computer makes work and studying fast and simple. When you need to research a topic for school there is always an endless library of information @CAPS6 you turn on the computer. You @CAPS7 get your information from books, and encyclopedias but it is rare that you always have time, to get to a local library. Also, @CAPS6 you have a project in school that you need to type, it is helpful to have a computer at home so you don't have to use at short. This way, you have more time to get extra from teachers @CAPS3 on instrument in the school band. I can imagine that my grades would be @CAPS6 i did have access to the internet of @CAPS4 @CAPS5 at home. Have you over pare or document and had an of her and happens @CAPS6 you own a computer you can backup @CAPS7 you imagine on essay five pages and organized is boring, bout you wouldn't think so @CAPS6 it saved you from hours worth of writing! For some people, having a computer @CAPS7 make you money, and who wouldn't like more money? You can run a business online and avoid the hustle of man ting a @CAPS8 your own space or building to run your business can be quite expensive and time consuming. Also, you can refrain from making a trip from the store by purchasing items online. Then, the item will be shipped to your door. You save time and money on gas by doing so. And those days, any way to save money is a good one! By having a computer you can boost your education.Keep yourself organized, and save money. Although it has many recreational purposes as well, it also can be very helpful in your life. And besides, is perfectly fine, to go online to talk to your friends once in a while, isn't it?"
4,"Dear @CAPS1 I think more and more people use computers because it can help you find a job if you lost it. Because right now some job are going bank raided. And pa rants can not help because they didn't have job to support there love ones. Another thing is that cars are going up on prices so if you don't have a lot of money you can go online and get a car and truck for great prices. And it can help you save a lot of money in your pocket. For some reason @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people like to go to far away places for example @CAPS2, put or @LOCATION1, @CAPS3. And you if go to these place then you would need place to stay and have a good meal with your family or friends. So you would need a nice pleasant hole title which will have aw some food, beds, pools and more thing people like to do when they is on vacation. And for example if your mother or father what you to go to your public school but you don't what too because you hear ed something or about the school say because you cant find great school online for example @CAPS4, cap pare, classical, Rizal, And some other school are the best to and fun to go to and be successful with your life. Now you know why more and more people use computers and you should always use technology and it would help you on the hand eye giving people the ability to learn about use computers."
4,"Dear Newspaper, In my opinion I think computers do have a positive affect on people. They can learn about far away places. They let people talk online. It can even help you find a job. This is why I think computers are very positive. Certainly, people can learn about far away places on the computer. Say, someone wanted to take a trip to @LOCATION1 they can look it up, learn the linage. They can by tickets. They could also find interesting things to see in that country. These reasons are why I think a computer is a positive technology. My next reason I think a computer is positive toward people is that people can communicate online. This can help keep families in touch. It can help you find and talk to old friends (Facebook). You can even make new friends to talk to. These are other examples why I think computers are positive. My last reason I think computer have a positive affect on people is that it can help you with jobs. It can help you find a job. It can also help you with your job. Lastly, it can have you have a higher position at your job. These are my reasons I think computers are important and positive to people. For all the reasons above are reasons I think computers are an awesome =) and positive technology, I mean just look at all the reasons. They let people talk online. They can also teach you about far away places. And even help you with your job. This is why I think computers have a positive affect on people."
4,"According to the @ORGANIZATION1 government @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 spend @NUM1 hours or more on a computer a day. A study shows @CAPS1 are't getting enough exercise, aren't spending enough time with family, aren't enjoying their lives. Right now people would rather be on the computer then doing other stuff.Since more people have been using the computer those people heven't enough exercise. Now @PERCENT2 of @CAPS1 have gone obese since they have always been or the computers, @CAPS4 year a @CAPS6 was fit and healthy, but when a friend told him about a website within the @CAPS5 @NUM2 minutes. After @NUM1 months, the fit and healthy @CAPS6 became obese. The @CAPS6 would always have junk food when @CAPS7 was on the computer. when @DATE1 came, @CAPS7 try ed out for his school baseball team. @CAPS7 didn't make it because @CAPS7 was out of shape. After that happened, @CAPS7 went to his old ways by eating healthy and exercising. Now that @CAPS6 is in shape for any sport @CAPS7 plays. Next people aren't spending enough time with their families. A lot of jobs require people to be on the computer. When that happens a person will forget whats really important to them. A couple years ago, a @CAPS6 was going to have the biggest game of his life. It was the championship game. @CAPS7 was reminding his dad about it all. When the gone was about to start, the @CAPS6 looked into the crowd for his dad. @CAPS7 didn't see him at all. The @CAPS6 was just think his dad was. after the @CAPS5, @CAPS7 looked again, but now @CAPS7 was sad. His own dad wasn't at the game. His team @CAPS4 the game. Now his dad doesn't miss a thing since @CAPS7 doesn't go on the computer as often. Finally, people aren't enjoying their lives they would rather be on a computer than doing stuff they like. One @CAPS6 used to always play basketball with his friends when @CAPS7 started to go on the computers, everything changed people would ask him to play, but @CAPS7 would say no. The computer was the only things that mattered. When the @CAPS6 try ed out for his @CAPS8 school @CAPS7 didn't make it because @CAPS7 forgot how to play. When that happened, @CAPS7 stopped using the computer and went back to basketball. now when @CAPS7 tries out., @CAPS7 makes. It's now or never to decide either waste your life on a computer or live your life. I would rather live life than be on a computer."
4,"I am so happy, I just finished my school report on @PERSON1 and I didn't even need to leave my house. I was able to talk with my classmate and ask her questions online. I also managed to get all the information just from my computer. I also learned how to row a boat, to show my class how @LOCATION1 crossed the @CAPS1 river, I learned that by taking on online course. This is one situation why computers have fantastic effects on people in everyday situations. Local research show that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 planning their vocation use the internet. The reason these citizens use internet is to get the information about the hotel and vacation cite. That is one way that makes computers helpful and positive devices, because it makes it easier for busy @CAPS2 to get ready for a trip by looking at pictures of the hotel online and getting all the info they need. Doctor @PERSON2 of @CAPS4 university says ""computers now offer programs that allow busy @CAPS2 to learn a new skill, @PERCENT2 of @CAPS2 currently use this software. ""@CAPS7 everyday @CAPS2 don't have time to go out a join a group or class to learn new skills. That is why computers are so helpful and people just love them. Instead of leaving home they can be cooking, doing yoga, or speaking a new language all from their computer at home. That is another reason why computers are useful in very positive ways. Imagine forgetting your homework at school and not be able to an A in that class. Well because of computers forgetful students can talk to a classmate online and get the homework and do it. Or they could even use the internet to go to that school website and find the homework and print it out. Many students around the country forget homework once in a while, because of helpful computers they can fix their problems easily. Let's recap, students or adults can get information off the internet for projects or even vacations. Busy @CAPS2 who don't have time to leave their house can take a class or learn a new skill right on the computer. Anyone can use the internet to talk or chat online to get school work or to long distance friends. That is why the effects on computers to people are nothing but positive. Now what can you do? It is important that computers stay in our lives, they are helpful and we have learned to live with them, which is why they must stay. This benefits you because newspaper houses are organized by computers and it keeps you business running."
4,"Many People in Society think computers are bad, I think computers are excellent. Computers allow you to communicate with your friends, family and relatives. With a computer you can do home work extra fast, no having to go to the Library to look stuff up. Computers also allow you to take out anger on ones and zeros. Muny experts like @ORGANIZATION1 think people will talk to stranger on website like Facebook and MySpace. If parent place him son the websites and also make it so only Friends can you profile you will be alto safer. Comunications engineer @PERSON1 says that it is better for people to talk from it online than not I know he is correct because I have relative in the @LOCATION1 that I love talking to but they are @NUM1 miles away so communication is or I to get, then I got a Facebook and it is like they are next door. @CAPS1. @ORGANIZATION2 @PERSON1 says that @PERCENT1 of strangers that are mole stores/ thugs go, after, people who don't protect their profile so protect your profile and be safe. Computers are better than going to the Libra! This is theee because going to the Library means you have to round up the kids get in the cor and go. With a computer you can just go into your office and do re search, That saves money or gas. If you have a project of you can just send it straight to they teacher. In many today experts like @CAPS1. @ORGANIZATION2 a conducting experiment that are rigged. Violence they say is cursed by the games but they use test subjects like an the bad people you dint want to meet. I Have found video games to be a great let out for stress bout up during the day. Muny of my friends have also found this. Video games make you think that is also reason they are good. In conclusion computers are excellent. They make it so thee is the ability to communicate with friends allow you to take out anger. What is not to love? Get a computer now!!"
4,"Dear Local Newspaper, I agree with the concerned experts, I'm sure many others agree also. I bet you that if you keep reading it would be understandable, why I agree. First of all, too many people spend to much tI'me talking with friends online. I think that once you start talking with them online, finish up the conversation face to face or by telephone. Talking online is a great way to connect with friends and people you haven't seen in a long tI'me, but too much of that can start problems. For example rumors. In my opinion when friends get to excited online they decide to start rumors about other people and it ends up being sent to almost everybody. Another example is online arguing which can lead up to many problems like fighting when you get back to school. How would you feel if you turned on your computer and find out that someone has been talking about you or that someone is trying to start a fight with you? I'm positive that you would not enjoy it and your feeling might be hurt. Next reason is, being on the computer too much can effect most peoples grades. Many people are going home and turning on their computer instead of doing their homework or studying. There are many people who go to my school and their grades have declined because of online usage. Pretty soon many people will be held back because they have failed the school year. For example, picture yourself as a parent and getting your child's report card and find out they have all @CAPS1's or mostly @CAPS2's. You wouldn't like that either. Lastly, computers have cause another problem called bullying. Too many children are being bullied online and they are being hurt. Those children who are being the bullies are enjoying it while the children who are getting bullied are sad. Thinking that nobody cares about them. Bullying has caused death or many other problems. Imagine, being someone, getting bullied and your feelings are really hurt, you dint talk to an adult or a parent all you end up doing is killing yourself. Picture how many parents are upset and how yours would be too to find that their child has been bullied to death, it really hurts them. And i'm sure if you were one of those parents you wont be too happy. In conclusion, being online too much has an effect on everybody and"
4,"I walked outside to get the mail and newspaper. I saw the front page talking about computer. An article said, too much computer using. I though there wasn't going to sell more computer but, it said that people are using computers and are not exercising much. I think that people are not going to have a hard time quitting to use their computer. I had a friend that didn't know how to use the computer. He past his hour playing outside. In the @DATE1 he tries out for @CAPS1 baseball. He is a very good athlete. He does grate in school too. Others people without a gob are not looking for something 'to do they are at the computer everyday. When they should be doing work around and inside the house. Peoples with computers shouldn't be all day like these friend my friend haves is using his computer every time he comes from school. He don't do his homework on time. Every time he doesn't want to go out and exercise his mind or get a little bit of sun he sometimes don't eat so he should give his brain a rest and do physical things that will help them. Other person such as the computer workers should write a note to people with computer saying how computer can be addicted to people and maybe realize how much often they should use their computer and was using it to go to get information and to collage. She started to use the computer to chat with people and ended up using the computer a lot and not going to collage. I believe that computers are an major impact on people. People should be going about to have fun get sunlight not staying at the computer all the time. Many adults don't use the computer is most the teens and kids. People should go to the gym and build strong muscles. They should stay away from computer for a time. Agains computer would be the right thing to do."
4,"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 opinion on computers is that they have a positive affect on people. I think this because I know some people that excesses and go on the computer mainly, I don't think computers are a bad thing. Some people learn on computers. They learn how to exercise. Sure some people just chat and learn about that far away place they could go there and explore the butty and nature. I think computers are great effects on people, They help out a lot. I know @CAPS2 uncle that came from @LOCATION1 he learned how to speak English of the computer. He learned a lot and we were all proud. Some effects that computers have on people are a lot. People have classes online they go to @CAPS3 mothers that are single that have kids for example, they get their diplomas and degrees of the computer online. And theirs other @CAPS3 @CAPS2 aunts and uncles they go to English classes online and work. A lot of people have classes online. @CAPS3 i go on @PERSON1 all the time all the time. @CAPS4 teaches me how to type. @CAPS4's fun, but also educated. I think that all computer have positive effects on people. All of them should their should'nt be one computer with negative effects on people. But that's only by @CAPS2 opinion. Computers are @CAPS3 robots they do lots for us. We type reports, learn, read online. And then threes also were we play games online, and educated games. I believe that their are lots of resources. You could search up a lot of stuff. For example you could search up: mastery, animals, natures and places. You wouldn't believe how many results the computer has. So who would have negative effects of the computer. All @CAPS4's trying to do is help us and out education @CAPS4 helps me with @CAPS2 Spanish sometimes. So why would people think that computers arn't good ideas? Computers are great for everything. I could go on and see what the weather is for tom morrow. Also I could see what the news are, and i could contact @CAPS2 teachers through the computer. I think a computer would always have a positive affect on people."
4,"Dear Local @CAPS1, I am delighted to write this letter to you. It has come to my attention that the people who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. I agree with those people. I agree with them because one: you can communicate with your family and friends via email, via @CAPS2, via @CAPS3 eats. Number two: you can use a computer for research, and number three: it can tell you directions or give you info. on a restraint or place you want to go. I will now get into more detail on these three topics. You can communicate with your family or friends via computer. For example my friend am or, when we were best Friends and we were in third grade, he had to move to @LOCATION1. I cried the first day he moved. then the next week or so I got an email from him and so now we can keep in touch with each other. He comes & to @LOCATION2 every @DATE2 and we hangout with each other. Maybe one day, I will like to go visit him now In @LOCATION3 because he moved again, but I will have to do some research on @LOCATION3 first. With a computer you can research alto of things like this year our language @CAPS4 class read a book called ""my brother @CAPS5 is dead"" and it was a true story. Se we had to some research on the book and I found out that without computers how would I be able to research anything on the website it shared where everything , a description of the thing, and how to get there (directions). Directions are very important. The show you how to get to a certain destination. You can get directions off a computer. I remember one year I had to go to my friends birthday party and we didn't know how to get there. So I went online on @DATE1 and we got the directions from there and we printed them out and we found the place in @NUM1 minutes. Without a computer we would have been able to find the house easily. You @MONTH1 disagree with me on this because a computer can have bad websites and can also became very addicting to some people, but I think I am right. Thank you for reading this letter, once again computers are good for the study!"
4,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you know that computers can prevent you from doing a lot of things? Instead of going on the computer you can exercise more, play outside, and spend more time with family and friends. This is why you need to spend less time on the computer. Exercise is important to your body and computers are not. you can get some weights and exercise in your room. A run out the beach doesn't sound bad either. Just by doing that you lose a lot of weight and not gaining weight on the computer. So go exercise and lose weight because it's good for you! Computers also prevent you from getting fresh air and playing outside. When your are outside you see that playing is much better than just pressing buttons and clicking everywhere. On the computer. You don't even have to play outside, you can just walk with someone or just sit on the grass and talk. The computer prevents you from doing all of this fun activities outside. Spending time with your family is a huge activity that your computer is prev ting you to do. You are on the computer for an hour and your family is having a barbecue. You finally get off that computer and you realize that spending time with them is so much fun than sitting down and looking at the screen. this is why computer are a distraction to everyone because you don't want to exercise, play outside, or spend time with the family. you can use the computer but just don't stay on to long because you are missing the fun."
4,"Dear local Newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion on the affects of computers is that while there are good benefits that come out or them, I believe more strongly that negative issues and situation arise from computers and that they affect people with greater impact in a not so good way. @CAPS1 three main reason as to why I think there are more negative impacts than positive and constructive impacts from computers are @CAPS2bullying is a very big issue. Also there are many 'scams' and 'cons' out there on the @CAPS9. Lastly there is a lot of misleading or wrong information online. Going back to @CAPS1 first reason, ""@CAPS2bullying."" @CAPS2bullying can be drained as rude or nasty teasing over the @CAPS9. On social networking websites such as @CAPS4 @CAPS5, @CAPS6, and so on. '@CAPS2bullying' can include teasing, hurtful comments horrible name calling and fowl language. It is much more effective than regular bullying, such as ""Give me your lunch money"", because once you put words out on the @CAPS9, you can never take them back, no matter how hard you try. '@CAPS2bullying' is the new generation of mean. Secondly, scamming and cons come out of the @CAPS9/computers. When purchasing items online, you never really know what your going to get. @CAPS1 father was scammed, or connect on the @CAPS9. He was looking on what seemed like a very official site to purchase a big boat. He drove all the way to @LOCATION1 to get it. He took it out on the water in @LOCATION2, at our @DATE1 home, and the engine and motor were broken. That is what can happen when buying something off of the @CAPS9. Lastly, misinformation can be another negative impact from computers. When researching a topic, you should stick to the library, it @MONTH1 sound old fashioned and slow, but when you research on the @CAPS9, you need to remember anybody can put or post anything, even misleading or untrue statements and 'information' online. Researching topics is not the only way to get false information. People can pretend to be who they are not in real life, which is why anonymous chat rooms and instant messaging are dangerous and unreliable. As a conclusion, the @CAPS9 basically has stronger negative impacts and consequences than positive ones. Because @CAPS2 bullying, scamming or conning and misinformation are all negative factors of the @CAPS9, and outweigh the positives."
4,"Dear @LOCATION1, Have you ever found yourself thinking about the computer, or wishing you were on it? I heard you were looking to see if computers have negative or positive effects on society. I feel that it is a negative effect because of less time exercising Little time with family or friends, and is very it's easy to became addicted to. Exercising, a very important thing for a healthy body and mind @CAPS1 have a hard enough time finding time to do this. So instead of that free time to exercise, they will probably be on Facebook. Also the maintenance of the computer will take away time for exercising. Just @DATE1, my computer got a virus I had to get fixed and that took for ever. That time while I fixed it could have been valuable exercising time. Another key point to look at is obesity. We should be up and moving not just setting and staring at a computer for @NUM1 hours at a time. I love to spend time with my friends and family. I mean who doesn't right? Computers only away from that kids well be on Facebook instant of eating a nice meal with their family. My @CAPS2 always told me stays of the (and stupid) things he @CAPS2 with his friend. Now wk ids just @CAPS3 easy. We will never have the social our parents I feel if is very important to spend time with and family because you never find when your going to lose them. Addiction is a serious matter. being addicted to the computer is too. Our generation is so dependant on computers. For example, in the car with the @CAPS4. You just plug it in and it ells you where go. What happens when it breaker? You will have know idea where to go because you never learned how to read a map. or what if your computer brakes? You will have to send a better by mail kids had be typing instead of writing. that skill would be lost and you would have to learn it again. As you can see, addition is a no laughing matter. Once again I must st reach the negative affect of computers to. "
4,"To whom it @MONTH1 concern, I think computers are a good thing. It is good because you get to learn about fore in places. Keep in touch with family and friends and it is good entertainment. First, computers are great to learn about fore in places. On the computers you could research a place and look at pictures before you go. If I wanted to go to a far away place like @LOCATION3. I would go on the computer and find the best part to go to and I would look at different hotels to stay at the reviews it has gotten. Aslo, if someone were to do a paper on a different country or even state that they've never been to they would go on the computer. Sure, you can get the same info from books but you can filter out what you don't need on the computer. In my history class, I had to do a report on the state of @LOCATION2. I have never been there so I want on the computer. Books could have given me the same info but computers are always up to date and accurate. Seecond, computers help you keep in touch with family and friends. There are numerous websites that allow you to share photos and talk to friends or family. I recently signed up for Facebook and I am able to talk to friends instead of using my texts and running over the phone bill every Mont. My dad has a Facebook too, he talks to people he hesn't seen since he moved heave from the @LOCATION1 white mountains. Some other sites are aim, AOL, and MySpace. Lastly computers are good entertainment. Computers allow you to see that concert you didn't go to or that movie that's never on TV. When I went to a skate board demo at skate lair I had tons of fun. The other day though, I started thinking about it. I went on YouTube and type in""nike Sb skate lair demo"" and clicked on it. i watched it and about halfway through it I saw my face! i was so exited. Computer also allow you to check the news and weather. This is good because if you are on the road and you want to see what's going on you can take out a laptop and checked the weather or news. That is why I think computers are necessary. Yes people do stay on four hours at a time but most people only go on for a small amount."
4,"Dear Newspaper, I firmly believe that people do spend a lot of time on computers, alto of teens spend alto of time on computers, I also think this from my own experience and I surveyed @PERSON1's @NUM1 grade @CAPS4 class. I would first like to expand my idea of teens spend alto of time on the computer, some teens go on the internet and do homework or might check their emails others go on @CAPS1 for hours and got addicted, so they're not outside or doing sports. In my own experience I used to have a @CAPS1 and I would be at it for the whole day and I would miss out on hanging with my family and friends. So I deleted the account. But, I still feel addicted to the computer I'm always listening to music or charting with my friends or checking my emails like most people The things* And lastly else to @PERSON1's @NUM1 grade @CAPS4 class, @PERCENT1 of people a day on it, @PERCENT2 said that they spend @PERCENT3 of people. That they now go on the computer. These that just one @NUM1 grade class most students are addicted to it.* no matter what age. This is why I believe that people do spend to much time or the. Many students go on @CAPS1 for hours at a time and in my own experience I have been addicted to the comp. and @PERSON1's @NUM1 grade @CAPS4 class when I surveyed them there ans a very high percentage of people that said they were addicted to the computer. So parents please tell your children if they need to spend less time on the computer."
4,"Dear @LOCATION1, I think computers are a great tool for everyone if they use it right. Here are my reasons why. First of all, I think computers are good because news travels quickly. Using the internet, world changing news can spread like wildfire and inform everyone in seconds. It is great for staying in the loop and reading about things you need to know. This reminds me of the time when a massive earth quake hit @LOCATION2 and traumatized its citizens. Within moments of the accidents, it was already circling the internet. This brought mass attention to @LOCATION2 which caused many people to donate and needed items. Secondly, the computer is also good for researching topics for school and common interest. If you need facts for a school project you can easily search what you need through the internet wide variety of search engines, you will be able to pinpoint exactly what you are also look up things that interest you. If you have a favorite sports team, band, or are interested in a famous figure, you have tons of information on them at your disposal. You can do all of this within the privacy of your on home so you can remain as secret as a @ORGANIZATION1 agent. This reminds me of the time when are of my idols died. Within seconds of hearing the tragic news I was able to search the topic and get an endless euphoria of information regarding his death. Finally, you can chat with someone from around the world if you wanted to! Using social networking sites like Facebook and MySpace, you can connect with your friends and chat with them for hours on end. You can also enter chat rooms with people who share a common interest with you. Just like how I talk to people about a band we both love. I believe access to news, research, and staying in touch with your friends is without a doubt the best reasons to use a computer. What are you waiting for? Get one!"
4,"Dear @CAPS1, I am writing this letter to inform you about my opinion on the effects computers have on people. I don't agree I think the experts are correct that people are spending too much time on their computer. My following reasons will explain why I don't agree. I think there is also an issue with computers. Please read on to understand my reasons. First of all, my reason on not agreeing with those who support technology is because their is no safety! I think chatting online is great but dangerous. For example, most kids are followed by and its usually online. This is because the information all to unknown people. Also, kids get into dangerous for example they get kidnapped for this informal and the people they talk to. Secondly, I don't agree because it also caused addiction to the computers. Most people get addicted for the certain things they do online. These life of can also become dangerous. For example, people play some video games which people killing and committing crime. We cant not do in the ""real' world. These kind of game also bring people to dangerous. Another example is we've had students bringing because violence is the answer when it ! The addiction to computer is so bad that people do have a look of and interacting with things. Lastly, I dint agree because its also. Most people who are and again. These of into an life because you do enjoying at all. For example, people die of. This letter will effect others so thanks for reading. Hopefully, people understand why I dint agree."
4,"Dear Local newspaper, @CAPS1 are big augments about if computers are good or bad. I think that computers benefit our society. Why, because it makes socializing ea sir, You can gain lots of education and also help with businesses. Wow, I cant believe how easy it it to at her people with computers. Computer are helping family chat with family and friends chat with Friends. It help peoples socialize by letting messages on paper that to be forever to deliver and to get one back, also if family members go away on a vacation you can still contact them. Or simply if a friend cant get a ride to another friends house they on still talk on the computer. Also a computer gives you an opportunity to socialize with people all over the world. Its amazing how easy it is to talk with other people with the computer. I really astonishing how much education we have gained from using the computer. Computers have given us to many part to learn. Before computers you learned about things from books, And many of those books could not teach you as well as a computer does. With a computer you can learn about space and stars and planets. Also with computers you can learn about other nation. What @CAPS1 culture and landscapes are like without even being @CAPS1. Computers have truly played a vital role in our education. Computers have done lots of things but not as much stuff as the did for businesses. The computer itself was a business and people model lots of money. It helped businesses organize @CAPS1 work and money also its given people lots of jobs working on computers. Also it gave businesses, quicker, more officiant way to put up for people to by @CAPS1. Computers have played a vital role in creating our economy. Computers have made socialize long easier. The ability us to get more education. Also it helps with our businesses This is why I think that computers have benefited our society."
4,"Dear @CAPS1 Newspaper I'm writing a letter to you about how I feel about the effects that computers have on people. One of my reasons is that people that spend to much time on the computers they are lit ting their life's pass by them. But the people that work on computers all day is a different thing. My second reason is that people could be on the computers and still interact with their family because they live with each other. My last reason is why do people want to be on computers all day. I'm not talking about the people that work on computer. My last reason is that the people that is spending all their time on the computer they are letting their life's pass by there. The reason I say this is because if you are on the computer @NUM1 your life is passing by you. Because you are not doing nothing, just sitting in a chair in the computer getting fat. Also if you are going to be on the computer at least they to find a job on the computer. But I'm not talking about the people that work in computer all day long, because they have to do it. Its their job to. Thats one of my reasons. My second reason is that the people this me in the computer they still interact with their family. The reasons I say this is because you could be on the computer and will interact with my family because you live it the same huge as them, two when you are not in the computer you could be with your family and spend time with them. That's why i said that you still could interact with your family even you see on the computer. The last and final reason is do people to spend most of their life's on the computer. The person I like this because type of person would spend most of their life on the computer and don't go find a job go enjoy their life. Also if you got kids you have fun with your children and make them believe that they parents that was to them, that, they had fun with them, and that they had somebody that they could look up too. So don't spend your life time on the computer getting fat, not spending time with their children and make something yourself. But I'm not talking about the people that work on computers. I'm talking about the people that don't work on computers. Thats why I said don't let you re life pass by you. i hope you liked the prompt and that you wont spend a lot of your life in the computer doing nothing just getting fat and letting your life pass you. I'll report myself again I'm not talking about the people that have to work in the computer. I'm talking about the people that don't work in computers."
4,"Computers are a common household item these days. Due to how much computers are able to do, most people spend a lot more time on the computer than they should, and it is affecting our society. Computers can be very helpful, when trying to find information on a topic, but some people take it too far. Some people, their jobs are on computers. Others like teenager will do gaming or have instant messengers, which sometimes takes away from outside activities. Another situation with computers is that adults can get really into online gambling which is terrible for a person to do even at a casino, but now they can do it from their living room couch. Computers can also keep you in from outside, to get fresh air and sunlight. Computers are bad in someways but good in others. Sometimes computers are a perfect resource. When your history teacher assigns you a @NUM1 page essay on the civil war and you have no idea what hap pend in the civil war. In this case computers are good. Or your boss could tell you to find the amount of teen deaths in car accidents due to cellphones. Computers seem like a perfect resource. So far you've learned computers have their highs and lows but if computer time was limited then people would be able to do more stuff outside, or read a book. Some people might abuse computers others might not but if computer time was just limited I be live, that a lot of things would be different in our society today."
4,"Dear editor, I see that there is an argument between computers being good or bad. I think that my op pinon can help your decision. I think that computers are good. I think they are good because they help kids with social skills, they help people with bad handwriting and they help people learn about things around the world. First of all computers help kids all around the world with social skills. They help them because these is so many ways to communicate with people through the computer. There is instant messaging and welcoming websites. Also a serve said that @PERCENT1 of parents say that the computer raised there kids social skills a lot. Another thing the computer helps with is people with bad handwriting. It helps because you can go on Microsoft word and instead of writing a great report that no one can read you can type I that when I have a paper for school that neatness counts on I always up my report. This can help alto of people who cant write as well as others because on the computer you change the font and everything to make it look as nice as you want. The last reason I think the computer is a good idea is because alto of people dint like to read newspapers and watch the news so they like to research certain subjects they like, to know whats going on around who world. I know my mom doesn't have time to watch the newest the newspaper but when she checks her email the first thing that pops up is the big est news of the day. People all around the work go so the computer to find of the latest news. I hope you consider my op pinon when you make you decision, where you go think of all the kinds of people it helps. People with social problems, people with bad handwriting, and just busy people who cant sit down and watch the hour news. Thank you for your time."
4,"Dear Readers, @CAPS1 you imagine not talking to distant friends, only knowing about your town, or even failing @CAPS5 you didn't ha a @CAPS3? I know I couldn't. Some of the great benefits of having a @CAPS3 are talking online with friends, learning about new places and things everywhere, and being able study for and tests from the internet. First, being able to talk to distant friends and relatives is now passive with the @CAPS3. Facts show show that @PERCENT1 of families in the @LOCATION1 have distant friends with @CAPS2, now all of these people can talk to each other! Ill never forget the time that my close Friends moved, but i was still able to talk to him @CAPS5 of the @CAPS3. Second, the @CAPS3 allows you to learn about new places and things all around the world. I never would have I know about some of the places I've been to if it was for computer, @ORGANIZATION1 stated that the @CAPS3 expert @PERSON1 says ""@CAPS3 are the reason we have in much without @CAPS3 wouldn't know about the places."" @CAPS4, it is now possible study without @CAPS5 of the @CAPS3, @CAPS6 can be done on the internet online. I'll never forget the that I forget my book, but I @CAPS1 still study @CAPS5 of the online book. In conclusion the @CAPS3 has benefits to you, like interacting with friends online, learning about new places, and being able to study. Computers are just end all around benefits."
4,"Dear newspaper I don't think that computers benefit our society. I dint believe that computers can be dangerous they make people lazy and you can be easily scammed on the computer. One reason why I dint think that computers benefit society is because it is very dangerous. Computers are dangerous because people can get kidnapped or harassed. The town of @LOCATION1 police @CAPS1 says that over @PERCENT1 of kidnappings are from people that were met on social networks such as MySpace and Facebook. The police chief also says that their are many cusses about people being harassed by stalkers or people trying to harm them. Another reason why I dint think computers benefit us is because you can be scammed very easily on the computer. @PERCENT2 of people say that they have lost large am mounts of money due to credit card scam's on the computer. On computers their are sites that will act as if they are selling you something and take your credit card number and all of the other information that you give them and they will take your card and buy thing with it and you will have to pay for it credit card companies say that most credit card scams and frauds happen over the computer. The final reason why I don't believe that computers benefit us is because they make people lazy. Computers make people lazy because they are packed with a bunch of fun things like video games and you can watch videos and you could shop and you could see just about anything on a computer. I did some research and found that @PERCENT3 of people that are over weight have account's on multiple sites on computers. These are the reasons why I dint think computers benefit us. I hope you too heed to my advice."
4,"In my opinion, I do believe that computers are good for you. I agree so because one, it can help you to communicate with other family members around the world. Two, it can teach you new languages you really desired to learn, and three, it can keep you updated on whats happening around the world. First, i believe that computers are good for you because it can let you communicate with your long lost relatives you hardly see anymore. For example, if you miss any of your family members, you can simply go to your computer and search them up so you can type to them or talk to them through via chat mode, then you won't ever have that missing feeling anymore since you have a computer. In addition, computers can teach you how to learn new languages you alway's wanted to know, like, @CAPS1, or @CAPS2, or even @CAPS3 if you wanted! You can just simply go to your computer and type in ""language of @CAPS2"", and listen what it tells you of @CAPS2! Moreover, computers can keep you updated on whats happening around the world! It is way better to see it on computers than on tv's because computers give you more information about the situation of the event! Likewise, you could click, ""locate area"", on the computer and see in which area the incident took place in. You could also see the video's, behold the images, and seek the location of it on the computer. Sadly, my lecture has come to an . Those were my three main reasons why computers are good for people: You can communicate with long lost relatives of yours, you can learn new languages, and therefore be updated on the hats happening around the world. Would'nt you wan't to uphold those amazing events also?"
4,"The computer is a good way to contact family and friend. People send messages all over the world or just to fin. People like playing video games or be on websites that they like. People all over the world by laptops to travel to one place to another. Everybody don't be on computer because they think its not go to have but some people do like to have one to be sending messages to hang out with one another or be talking about how was your day. Many people want computer because they do have enough money to @CAPS2 one. Some computers cost a lot @MONEY1 money like, @MONEY3, or @MONEY2 and even more than @MONEY3, or @MONEY2 it depend witch one they get. Around the world many people sell their computers to get money to @CAPS2 different stuff like, shoes, clothes or games. They always sell stuff on eBay to get less or more money, instead they can't take the computer back to get your money or to get a new computer. People want the classic computers, but now they come out with new ones like, touch screen ones. Many people been buying them at @CAPS1 @CAPS2 or @ORGANIZATION1. Every sens the new computers came out people been buying a lot the company been making a lot @MONEY1 money from making the touch screen computers. Every new year the company make new computers so they can get thousands or @MONEY1. Company all over world make different computers to bring out new styles so people can like them and @CAPS2 them. New styles they make more money they make. Some people make their own companies to get money like the other company's get theirs, but some @MONEY1 the money you make some goes to the government. The money the give to the government is to take care @MONEY1 the homeless people. Computers are used from leaning or for fun. People share computers with other people they can't not share it because it wouldn't be fair. Some people take Turner using it. Some people don't like taking turn with one another. Everybody share or have they own and they use it or not they can't force their server to it if somebody wants to net on it. Some people lie and say they were getting on it. People like joking around with others. Parents always say a computer is not a tag to play with computers cost a lot to repair and get it fixed all the people spill water on them a the computer mess up and the people be mad and maybe he/she just got a new computer. When computer first came out people bought them to see what they will be like. Many people liked them and it got all over the world and people were talking about them and the company made more and more until it got in stores all over the world. The computer got farms and the company made newer styles for everyone else. People bought a lot @MONEY1 computers every time they come out with a new style. Many people had @NUM1, or @NUM2 at home as they @CAPS2 them. Companys made other company mad because the other company's were making better styles. People were ordering online to get new computers. And company how make them is making a lot @MONEY1 money. Company stopped making them until they came up with a new computer that is the @CAPS1 one ever. When they came up with one the company was mad that they mad a better one. Some company joined to make one together."
4,"Dear local newspaper, I agree that computers benefit us totally. This lets people explore the world and do anything. Also, computers are used for many things. Last but not least @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 households have at least one computer. So computers lets us do anything and everything. It helps most people with their jobs, college/school, and you can even buy a house or car online. It doesn't cost that much and its very use full. You can look up facts you need or even play games when your bored. It keeps us in touch with the world. Also, many thing require a computer. For example, In order to play box live you need a computer with @CAPS1. Xbox live lets you play video games with other people or even your friends. Some homework requires computers and some colleges are only on the computer so you can stay at home. Anything you need you can find it on the computer. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 house hold have computers, or @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 does. I agree that some people waste their time, but without computers everything would be much harder. For example, say you need to having to wait @NUM5 days for the mail. Just @CAPS2mail it. Most people wouldn't have a job if it weren't for computers. It saves peoples time and lets them do other things except have to drive somewhere to give a letter to them. So I think computers are a huge benefit. Like I said you can do anything. Like @CAPS3. It keeps you in touch with friends if your on vacation from school. They are also used for several different things like downloading music on your @CAPS4. Also, @CAPS5 everyone has a computer. If scientists are going to complain about computers than why do they use them? I think computers are great! But whats you opinion?"
4,"DeAR @CAPS1, "" Computers ARe great! They do so much for my family and me, i can't live wiThout a computer."" @CAPS2 my many local in The town of @LOCATION1. For me, computers ARe a place to have fun wiTh all The different applications. But They can also be used for reseARching anyThing you can imagine. I also Think Thai computer is important because it is where businessmen do Their job. My favorite pARt about The computer ARe applications like @CAPS3, @CAPS4, @CAPS5, and so many more. These apps. ARe great because on @CAPS5, you can talk to your friends if you don't have a cellphone, or talk to friends Thait live in anoTher state, @CAPS3. Easily my most favorite application, because I get to talk to my friends, look at pictures of Them, see who They ARe dating, and so many oTher endless possibilities, You can also play and download games onto your computer. It's always very fun to do Things on The computer Thait you enjoy, and not have to reseARch all The time. The second Thing on The computer, is reseARch. ReseARching can be fun and boring, however you look at it, But reseARching is educational, and I asked a moTher wiTh a @NUM1 yeAR old, a @NUM2 yeAR old, and a @NUM3 yelled and she said ""The most important Thing to me on The computer is reseARching. Its's fun, enjoyable, and most importantly, educational!"" The best Thing about reseARching is Thait, There ARe endless amounts of website es Thait have information for us to look at, and enjoy. People Thait work and have jobs, ARe mostly The ones on The computer, and a lot of Them AR reseARching while working. People Thait work, ARe Th ones Thait ARe basically on The computer @NUM4. Businessmen, designers, etc.... The computers ARe mostly used by workers for email. My faTher is always on The computer, checking emails, typing someThing for This boss; and even talking on a video conference. There ARe endless possibilities for workers because foe some of Them, computers ARe Their jobs. Computers, in my opinion, They'ARe one of The best Things created. They ARe The best because They have amazing apps. for me to have fun on. But They also provide an educational opportunity Through reseARch. And They ARe great for people wiTh jobs. I don't Think There is any person Thait can live wiThout one of These technological beauties."
4,"Dear @CAPS1, I am writing you this letter to give you my opinion on computer use. In my opinion, I think that some people use and rely on computers too much. Wether it be for a research project, talking to friends, and even answers for homework. Everyday millions of people are on the computer for hours straight. Moving your fingers doesn't count as exercise and it wastes energy. Many people I know would die if they didn't have a computer because friends are on or made because they need if for homework. These type of people need to be taught how to get things done without technology because are day it might fail. Some students rely on there technology to work or they will fail. These children need to be taught that there is other ways to do things. Like hanging out with friends, reading a book, and even doing their homework. Since students rely on their computers so much then always on them. Every day people I know go home and jump on @CAPS2 for the rest of the day. They never can do anything like going outside and doing sports. Many kids do not do any type of athletic sport. Obessity is a huge problem in the @LOCATION1 are the numbers keep increasing drastically. Everyone thinks that it is begging caused by bad eating habits, that's only half of it. People overusing their computer is also a big problem. Children around the @LOCATION1 are stuck on their computers all day checking message, and seating up pictures. While these children are on the computer they dint even think they just chow down on ""@CAPS3"". This computer usage problem is begging to become at big deal with the obesity and hold much people rely on it for basically everything. So we need to be the first people to stop this be for it forms bad. This could be a huge problem in the future. So lets start to cut our usage time down now."
4,"Dear @CAPS1, I think computers aren't good for people because they could spend that time exercisING, hangING out with friends and family and readING. The first reason I don't think computers are good for people is because they could spend that time exercisING instead of @CAPS2'ING you could ride your bike or even walk the dog, exercisING @MONTH1 be hard work but, it's better then starING at your computer screen. Just because you eat well dosen't mean your healthy. You need exercise to stay healthy too. So, run, ING, walk the dog, go to a gym instead of sittING at the computer. Another reason I think computers aren't good for you is because in the time your on the computer you could be hangING out with your friends and family. Lets say your family is goING to the beach, you stay home to play games on Facebook. Your family comes back talks about all the fun they had, even tho you weren't there. You could have been apart of those memories. Now time to compare with your friends. Its movie night, all your friends are goING. But, you stay home to web cam with your aunt. You stayed home both times just to be on the computer. You missed out on a lot. My final reason I think computers are bad is because, instead of computer time it should be readING time. LookING at a computer screen and readING is a lot different then readING a book. ReadING books increases your vocabulary, you learn about different types of ligature. Over all readING books makes you smarter. When your readING online you just read what people say, basically rumors. READ! In conclusion I think people should spend more time exercisING, hangING out with family and friends and readING instead of beING on computers."
4,"@ORGANIZATION1, In today's age computers are seen everywhere and they have been so helpful. They act as an information highway and connect people together. The new advances in technology have had a positive effect on humans all over. First off, computers "
4,"Dear Local Newspaper, I believe the computer does have positive perks, but it also has negative perks. Reason one you loose interaction with people. Reason two you then forget to excessive. Reason three, your health is in jeopardy. Firstly, you loose interaction with family and friends. Because you would spend so much time on the computers. It ruins your marriage if you are married. If you have kids you risk your relationship with them. I am not saying to stop using computers. Because I use them myself. I am saying don't make your life the computer. It's not good for you! Secondly, you need excessive. Stastics show @PERCENT1 of the people who live on their computers gain weight faster would know because as @NUM1 yr old I have gained a little weight because of computers. Most people when on the computer tend to eat more @CAPS1 are all well known facts. That have been proven. Since, you can't walk with a computer in hand, you stop moving. Meaning you stop exercising. You have to limit your time and then there is where I believe they (computers) benefit you. Lastly, your health is very much at stake. If you are at the computer for @NUM2 hours at a time your eye site will pay. My eyes stink when I am on the computer for half an hour. Doesn't your head hurt when you are the computer for so long? Yes, the computer is fun and it gives you things to do, I am the first one to admit that But, it also hurts your heath. For being on the computer for so long you are at risk for carpal tonal syndrome. Which is very painful. Computers are so much fun and make life easier. But, they have disadvantages. Reason one you loose interaction with people. Reason two you stop exercising. Reason three your health is at risk. If you limit time, everything will be alright!"
4,"Have you ever wondered what life would be like without computers? Some experts are concerned that people are using too much tI'me on the computers. I believe we should still use computers. Without a doubt using a computer helps us learn. The computer helps us learn about other places in the world. @PERCENT1 of people say they would love to look at beautiful places in the world. Computers also can teach you how to speak a language. @PERSON1 of @ORGANIZATION1 says that ""taking Spanish online helped I'm a lot on her class. Computers now offer online study groups that can help us get into a college. Many people would agree that using a computer helps us learn new things. Its a fact that you instead other people on computers. You meet new people when you are in the computer. MOSt people live meeting other people online. You also learn social on the computer. @PERCENT2 of people say they learn social on the computer. People also can learn to have a personality because they in use. @PERSON2 says that ""because I got on the computer I didn't have the personality but I feel like a whole person. As you interact with people on the computers. Did you know that a computer teacher in life say if you need to use a computer in your will one already. @PERSON3 says that using a computer helped you type. Using a computer helped hand eye coordination. You type a lot of essays in college too OS that can help you as well. So now you know that a computer helps you in the future. Without a doubt people should still use computers are helpful in many ways. So what are you waiting for go out and go your computer today!"
4,"Dear local newspaper, Have you even been on a computer too long & haven't spent time exercising, or haven't spent any time with your family? Well, that's a big problem here in the @LOCATION1. In my opinion, to make this problem better, people should only be allowed on the computer for a certain amount @ORGANIZATION1 time & after they enjoy themselves with a nice workout, time outside & most importantly with their families. I think this will make the problem better, because you can enjoy yourself a little bit more rather than getting home from school & shooting right to wherever your computer is & being on it for the rest @ORGANIZATION1 the night. I also think this will help the problem because it will also allow you to get better grades. If your on computer all the time & don't have any time to excesses, go outside, and bond with your family then that most likely means you have no time to do homework. By not doing homework, your grades could go lower & you most likely won't understand what you are learning in that class. This one problem ran also affect you so many other ways. The problem with computers & why people, mostly kids are so attached with them is because @ORGANIZATION1 websites such as twitter, Facebook, YouTube, etc. & kids are @CAPS1 to them. This is part @ORGANIZATION1 the problem because kids can't get off @ORGANIZATION1 them, they like it so much. This problem leads to the main problem because if parents say ""Time to get off... go get some fresh air."" the kid always goes ""one minute"" & the parents let them get away with that, but then that ""one minute"" turns into an hour at most. This is bad because by the time the kid gets off the computer, its dark out and they can't go run around outside. I think this is important because think that Facebook & twitter should be limited amount @ORGANIZATION1 time and should log you off after @NUM1 minutes. In conclusion, this problem is a national issue & in my opinion should be a new law, that kids have to play outside, and spend time with their families before going onto any computer. As you can see having all these great websites leads into a problem with kids. Thanks for your time on reading why I think computers are a big problem here in the @ORGANIZATION1."
4,"Imagine your life without the benefits @ORGANIZATION2 the computer. Do you think it would make life a little harder? Computers have positive effects on people for educational reasons and for a new way to developerr @CAPS3 skills. @ORGANIZATION2 is very important to our society. Computers can help with our educational needs. When a school project is going on more than @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION2 students use a computer to accessss the information they need. I agree that students depend too much on a computer and not on books, but the computer has more information to offer than the average book. The computer @CAPS1 lets us, as students, to broaden our horizon. The @ORGANIZATION2 stated that ""a near @PERCENT2 @ORGANIZATION2 students learn something new from a computer that they did not already know."" @CAPS1, in @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 @CAPS4 a student could find more information on a specific country than they could with a book. I predict that as a result @ORGANIZATION2 the informational accessss the computer gives us, that soon grades will boost at least @NUM1 to @PERCENT3. In a serve that was done by the @ORGANIZATION1, found that @PERCENT4 @ORGANIZATION2 students found more information, that was relevant, on a selected topic than in the whole school library. Next, the computer can help with hand eye coordination for young kids. In school students are observed to see how well or if there coordination is being developerrd. With @PERCENT3 @ORGANIZATION2 students having very little coordination, computer games lowered the @PERCENT3 to @PERCENT5. The computer does help with the educational needs @ORGANIZATION2 students in @LOCATION1. The computer is a great way to socialize with friends. It is a new and inventive way to communicate. I know that some @MONTH1 say that there is less time spent humanly interacting, but on the computer it is still interacting. With a phone you can only chat with each other, but a computer has a web cam. This device allows you to talk to people with some human interaction. Around @NUM2 to @NUM3 million @CAPS5 have this device to use. It @CAPS1 is installed into many @ORGANIZATION3 and @ORGANIZATION4 laptops, giving us portable accessss to talk. CEO at @ORGANIZATION3 said that ""@CAPS6 the laptops have come with c built in web cam, one out @ORGANIZATION2 every two that have it installed use it to chat socially and for business."" The computer can help with our communications for @CAPS3 or business needs. The computer is a good way to start and developerr with @CAPS3 skills. More than @PERCENT6 @ORGANIZATION2 children use a computer to start with the beginnings @ORGANIZATION2 their @CAPS3 skills. Computer allow many people to become @CAPS3 with each other in new and effective ways. In conclusion, the average computer can benefit our lives in positive ways. From our educational needs and to our @CAPS3 needs, the computer positively efforts us in these two very important ways."
4,"Dear Newspaper, I think people should use computers for specific reasons. One reason is that many people lose family or to be more specific lose contact with people. Then when you have a computer for someone else has one then you would be able to see them. For other purposes like wanting to play online with fellow student or friends then you have to use computers. Plus your fingers get a exercise when your typing. Many of us young kids say that MySpace and Facebook is a bad place. Actually its not because most of your family is on it. Doctors use computers all the time to notify other doctors that something wrong with a patient or give a visual of the breathing. Workers even use it to see whats going on with the jobs if threes any jobs open so they can take it. Students use it to show what work they have to do when the teachers not there. If i was a Carpenter of a real estate agent I would have a computer with me. The reason why is that my group would know what houses are available to use or that's sold. Or I would give them different house to choose from and give them a good deal on it. I would also bring a computer with me for GP's so i can know where I am. Many people use computers for different reason. Such as Pogo, cheat codes, @CAPS1 cards and other thing. My reason for using this is because my work is important to me. I would do it on the computers if I miss it. That is why you should have computers all the time. You newer know what would happen. In conclusion, This is why computers are very important to have. The reasons are for if something happens. To you and you don't have a phone use a computer. Also its beneficial that everyone has thing to do but computers are the best thing to do."
4,"Dear Local newspaper, I think computers are great sources. They help us instantly when we have to find something. Computers are very helpful and they are easy to use. Once you have mastered the computer it feels like you can do almost anything on it. Computers are great but the can also have negative effects on us too. I like, computers but I am going to say I am against them. When people get on their computers it's like they're in another world. When your on the computer you are alto less so cal than you would be if you not on the computer. On don't know about you but alto of people are addicted to their computers. They get on an they stay on forever. The act like it is a necessity to be on the computer every day. I do not have to be on computer websites like @CAPS1 and here is why. Compters get really annoy ting sometimes. They distract people alto. Like the other day my sister and I were going to @NUM1 walking but we didn't go because she wouldn't help us exercise so we shouldn't be using it. In this economy it is important to have so cal skills. Instant messaging people doesn't mean you are going so cal skills. You actually have to get out and talk to people face to face. When I am on the computer to long I know. I know this because my eyes start to hurt. This is bad for your eye sight. People sit in their houses and just stare at the bright screen. They @MONTH1 not know but that is blinding so they must not stay on the computers long. These were some reason why you should not use the computer. I am not saying that it is an evil contraption I'm just saying, use the computer for info and work not for games and other things. You could be outside having fun instead of sitting up in your house so get out! Go make some real breathing friends in person."
4,"Dear Newspaper, People should play with their family and friends instead of staying on the computer all the time. People would be more fit, have closer bonds with their family, and get better grades in school. People will Elway get fit faster if they excesses instead of staying on the computer. When the computer is unplug ed, anyone has a chance to go out side and play. When people go outside to play with their friends, they excesses which causes you to lose weight. @NUM1 scientist believe that it is better to go outside and socialize than to sit on a computer and watch monotonous videos. People would be more active if they stay of the computer and went outside because it will keep you happy with your body, and healthy so you don't die of a terrible diseases. Their would be closer bonds with families if people stayed of the computer. Family would be closer together instead of spreading apart by computers. Your family is Elways their to comfort you when ever you have a terrible day. Your family will help you get over any problem so that you can keep moving forward. If you did this by computer, all you see is a persons face who can't comfort you with a hug. Without computers, you get a closer family that loves and supports each other, but with computers, people just drive their families away. Closer families also help children in school get better grades. Families who stay of the computer and have dinner with their families typically have children that get better grades. @NUM2 scientist agree that kids who have dinner and play with their families get better grades in school. If kids get better grades in school from staying of the computer and spending quality time with their family, we could get great inventions that can help mankind in every single way. All of can happen from staying off of computers. Staying off computer is a great way to help yourself and other people to. It would get people fit, create closer bonds, and create more graduates who go on and achieve the greatest of all inventions. Imagine what else could happen by staying of computers."
4,"Dear The @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Experts say that computers are ""taking over people"", I strongly disagree. People spend the amount of time they need and want then become active or spend time with family and friends. Computers allow people to learn, they allow people communicate to family and friends, too. Also, @CAPS5 people use computers for work and jobs. I believe computers allow people, like myself, to learn. You can learn also @CAPS5 things on the computer. You can learn about other countries, you can read articles on news, also. You can learn different languages and about the world. Online people can communicate with others. There is Skype, which allows you to communicate with others while on the internet, you use a web cam. there is also instant mess anger, or @CAPS3. @CAPS3 is like having a conversation with a person who's right next to you! Then there is email which can send letters, photos and comments. @CAPS5 people use computers for work. Microsoft @CAPS4 allows you to type stories and type letters. @CAPS5 people do job reports on @CAPS4. Also, the internet is helpful for work. Websites and search engines help you a lot. Websites can contain information that working people need. To finish this letter, I want to say that @NUM1) Computers allow people to learn. @NUM2) They allow people to communicate with friends and family. Lastly, @NUM3) @CAPS5 working people use the computer for work and reports. I hope I influenced you to see why computers aren't bad."
4,"I strolled into my bedroom, I noticed the computer sitting on a wonder desk. I thought that computers are very helpful. There are many controversies on whether computes benefit or do not benefit society. My opinion on this topic is that computers are useful and I support this technology. Computers are excellent tools that could help students with work in school. For instance, this year I had a sciences project about how my hobbies interests are related to science. One of my interests in reading, @CAPS1 I had to research about how reading a simple back can be related to science. I went on the internet, typed in my question about reading, and two seconds later thousands of results up. I had even gotten some pictures too. A couple of days later after I had handed in my project, I received it back. I had gotten a @NUM1 on this project! @CAPS1 being able to use a computer really boosted my grade in science. Without the internet, I probably wouldn't have been able to get on A on this. As you can see, computers can help students with projects, etc. in school. Using this technology can help you reconnect with friends and family members. In elementary school, my friend @PERSON1 had moved away to @LOCATION1 @CAPS2. I had no way of communicating with her until I found a program on the internet that lets you chat with people. Both of us had been using this and we've been able to talk for on end. I don't see @PERSON1 as often as I had used to, but with my computer wide open in my bedroom I can chat online with her almost everyday. Computers can help reestablish old relationships with friends and family. @CAPS1 communicating on these are also another benefit. Using computers can help enrich peoples minds. For example, in school we use a program called, ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4."" @CAPS3 @CAPS4 involves you playing games that help you @CAPS3, and tests when you are ready to take them. @CAPS3 @CAPS4 has been helping us practice for the @ORGANIZATION1's. After taking multiple tests in subjects such as science, math, and language arts, I now feel confident about taking the @ORGANIZATION1's and I believe I am going to do well on these tests. As you can tell, the tool of @CAPS3 @CAPS4 on the computer can benefit your school grades. The effect computers have an people are that they help and benefit the society. I think that more citizens should own computers because they can expand your knowledge. I am clearly in favor of owning and using computers."
4,"Has your daughter or son ever asked you that they want computer in their school? Were you ever baffled when they said they were talk king about @CAPS2 in the school, that they can teach hand eye coordination, gives them the ability to learn from far away places, or even allow them to talk to people all around the world? What did you think about that? Did you agree? If you did then your thinking about the positive side and not the negative. Many reasons why I dint agree. Saftey, the money, health. Many people said that its good to interact with other people but not all the time if your son or daughter interacts with people they @CAPS1 know are you going to be worried.? They can be asked who they are, were they live. Sometimes they even ask if they can meet up face to face. My friend @PERSON2 said her school got those computers and her friend @PERSON3 was asked to meet or with somebody she never knew and she ended up saying yes and @PERSON2 says she never ed showed up. Would you ever want that to happen to your child? Well this is only the beginning. Once your child's school gets computers they will be addicted to @CAPS2, @PERSON1 said that ""if a child does not go out and enjoy there childhood but they want concentrate on their homework, they will just eat and be on the computer eventually they will become obese. @CAPS2 is very imperative that your child does go out and have fun and get exercise because then they will just be on the computers @NUM1. Have you ever wondered that? Another thing is the school will have to pay alto of money, if your child ever damages the computers then you will also have to pay a lot of money too. Not only if your child's school gets computers @CAPS2 will benefit you guys alto. I trolley and sincerely do not be live that students should get computers. Also your students computers @MONTH1 get viruses because of inappropriate sites. Then your going to pay for that as well. Lastly the school will not have enough money for materials. What will you do?!? Your child is not there to be addicted to computers your child is there for education! Do you still support these computers!? I hope not because there is a @PERCENT1 chance that they will or will not get @CAPS2. Hopefully I gave you enough information about the safety, money and health. This is very urgent situation so please be aware."
4,"Dear: local new spars @CAPS1 recently been brought my attention, that people should use computers. My three argument are they ta ch hand  eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about far away places and people, and even allow People to talk on line with othee people. @CAPS1 ta chs people hand eye coordination because when people type on the keyboard the more and more thee type on the keyboard and the faster and faster. Mach people have more coordination first, they get used to typing then, they start type ins fast last when they type fast @CAPS1 give them more hand eye coordination. Useins computers give people the ability to learn about far away Places and people because they could such Google people and places then @CAPS1 show a lot of wed site then when they go on one wed site they type in the person name and state then @CAPS1 show them the places of person. Computers give people the ability to talk with people from othee place like aim, MySpace or face book and people could play games and talk at the same time so the computer is very pop lure this time because of what people Mack theee wed site do and this is why I think people should use computer far a lot of like my three @CAPS2 so @CAPS1 been to my attention that people should use computer for three re son i is ta ch hand  Coordination give people the ability to learn abound far away places and people, and even allow people to talk online withe othee people so this is why I sagest people should use computer."
4,"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 you have a computer at home? Right now, more than @PERCENT1 of the people have at least one or more computers at home. Computers are common by now, but people argue rather they are really needed on our society. Computers give negative effects on people, for example, lose eye sight, interacting with strangers online and lack of outdoor exercise. One out of five people wear glasses or contacts, these days. the rate of people wearing glasses are increasing rapidly as well. Children and adults are spending too much time on the computer, which causes to lose eye sight. When people use too much computers, their eyes start to hurt and lead to a headaches as well. These are sign of spending too much time, but people tend to ignore it because they want to get work done, or simply addicted to the online video games. this shows that computers give terrible effects on society. When a person is on the internet, there is no limitation to him or her. Once a person is online, there are endless amounts of site to access on that are not always trusted. Online, where anyone can go on, there are millions of people that are not connected or related. In other words, strangers, interacting with people they don't know is very dangerous. They can have devastating influence, no supremacy, what so ever unless they are a teacher of same sort. Unfortunatly, people can not trust anyone online because they don't know who it exactly is. For example Facebook. People think they are private, but everything that is uploaded or posted is public. Also others will be able to view your profile even they are not friends with that person. this is not safe in any way. The rate of people getting addicted on the internet is increasing as well. These people tend to not go outside at all and stay home. These people get not enough exercises, which are very unhealthy they tend to get their meals done at fast foods which are unhealthy as well. For the reason, people on the computers get fat from the unbalanced meal and never interact with people outside and nature outside. In conclusion, computers have negative effects on society because, they increase the number of people wearing glasses and losing eye sight. Second, they are creating a unsafe environment. last it makes people have unbalanced meals and lose track of their diet. "
4,"Dear local newspaper writer, I'm writ ting to talk to you about the use of computers. I think computers benefit our com unties a lot. I feel this way because it can warn us about a natural disaster. It teaches us about everything & everything. Last we get to talk to people online In these next paragraphs ill share my thoughts about this topic to you. My first reason is natural disasters. Computers always warn us about them. For example when hurricane Katrina hit computers were able to see that on their. Many people was able to flee the city before that happened. States shows @PERCENT1 of the natural disasters computer classified them. Computers saves people live each & every. Anothee example is with the earthquakes that recently happened in @LOCATION1. Computers informed many people about them. Those were my reasons how computers warn us about natural disasters. My second reason why I say computers benefit us is because it teaches us about everything & anything we learn about faraway places, new word & things that is happening in our own country. For example I had to research a person my project & all I dis was type in his name & pages full of information popped. You will be amaze how much information the computer has. Comuter has everything you need on as person & so much more. this is my second reason why computers are helpful. My last reason we get to talk online. Now the has its pros & cons. Talking online is very fun. I mean you in many website, MySpace, Facebook, twitter. Its never ending. People can talk to old friends, family anybody really. But many people have to be careful cause their creeps out thee. Like say you can't meet up with you friend you can @ORGANIZATION1 or ova (web came) them. The computer is you friend. So you might as well make good use with it. This is my last reason now the computer can benefit you. In conclusion I think the computer makes the world that much easier. My reason why you ask. It warns us about, natural disaster. It teaches us everything & anything. Last up can talk online."
4,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Have you ever thought about people's views on certain technology? While some people say that others spend too much time on their computers, and are wasting their time, I think computers can help us with many different things. They can help with homework, interacting with people, and even help us with exercising. You'll find that in the end, computers end up as benefits for everyone. For many students, they need computers to help them understand their subjects. There are certain web sights that give online lessons. Along with that, they have online books, so if they forget their real ones, they can still do their homework. My math teacher, @PERSON2, is always saying,""@CAPS1 into the online sight."" I've found that it really helps me when I'm struggling with my work. We can also ask our friends with help if we still @CAPS4't understand. That's not all we can do. There are certain sights like @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 where we can interact with other people. You can talk to them when they're out of town and have no cellphone. You can also tack when the phone is being used and you have something importing to tell them, such as helping them with their homework. When there's no telephone reception between each other, they can still talk over one million people in the @LOCATION1 use these sights. People are wrong when they say it tackes their time away from exercising. Many web sights give good tips on how to lose weight. The show many dieting plans such as @PERSON3 or @PERSON1. Not only that, but they also have exercise plans. It's not the computer's fault, it's the people who @CAPS4't ""stick"" with exercising. Also, the computer recommends many great gyms you can join, like @LOCATION2 fitness. @CAPS4't you think that's a good ""deal?"" @CAPS4't listen to those other people stick with my opinion that computers are benefits for everyone. They can help us with many things, above and beyond. I can't imagine life without them. Most everyone uses computers! Thank you for reading."
4,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society and I am one of these people, that does not agree. I disagree, because is your on the computer all day you'll forget bout things. For example, you will forget to exercise, you will forget nature, you will also forget to interact with your friends and family. I promise you if you keep on reading you will understand and realize my point of view. People so end to much time on the computer, and they don't exercise like they should. Exerising is very important, that helps you with . Exercising helps you grow. it makes you stronger. If your on the computer all day then, you'll exercise and develop right. Another reason, I think its such a lead idea is you do not get to enjoy nature. When your on your computer you can not go on an hike in the woods. You can not go on camping trip. You can not do the thing, in the pleasant air of nature. The last reason but definitely not the least you will forget to interact with your friends and family. That is so important because a computer could do a lot. It could teach you a lot but it canto do it you and @MONTH1 I love you. Only you re family and friends could do that. Hopfully you under and realize my point of view. People should stop doing this you forget to exercise nature and to spend time with you friends and family. All I got to now thank you for the opportunity to listen to my idea."
4,"Dear, @CAPS1 I believe that people shouldn't spend so much time on the computer because they do less exercising, they don't interact with friends and family, and its bad for their health. People shouldn't spend so much time. They wont enjoy their life outside of their houses. My first reason why people shouldn't spend so much time on the computer is that its bad for their health. Spending to much time on their computers can strain your eyes. Some people with seizures including myself would trigger an attack and cause us to space out. Spending to much time on the computer can mess up your vision or damage your body. To me that's very unhealthy. Another reason why spending so much time on the computer is bad is that you don't interact with your family and friends. On the computer all the time can make you forget to spend time with your friends and family. You would get addicted to being on the computer all the time. You would forget to say hi and how are you to your family. You won't spend time with your friends and they will start to ignore you and think that you don't care about them. Being on the computer all the time will mess up your social activity's with other people. My final reason why spending to much time on the computer is bad is that your not enjoying nature. You don't realize how much you are missing because you are on the computer. Yes you can learn thinks by the computer but you can also learn by doing it yourself. Being on the computer to much will make you not want to exercise and that won't be good for your body. You would forget to at least go for a jog, discover new thing. You realize that exploring nature is better than just watching it. Those are my reasons why spending to much time on the computer is bad. Its not health. You don't interact will your friends or family. Also you won't enjoy nature for yourself. So just get off the computer and enjoy what life gave you."
4,"Dear local Newspaper, I think that computers have a good effect on people. My first reason is that some people at college are far away from home like my sister and my family talks to her through the computer. Also many people have an email! that tells them about sales at grocery stores or clothing stirs and it saves people money using those coupons. Statistics state that grownups that use the computer at night feel more awake in the @TIME1. My second reason is that if someone is going on vacation or they are moving they can go on the internet and find out if where there going is safe or if they have a nice school there and they can learn about the place and see what it looks like. they can also find out about colleges and see how nice they are see if its a small school if there are alto of kids that go to that school and etc. My third and final reason is that when people use the computer there. hand eye coordination gets better because when your typing your moving your fingers and your getting the feeling when you use it and your getting faster at typing. Also your not just siting there your moving your fingers and your using your brain. Scholastic kids states that kids who use the the computer and use the keyboard brings there @CAPS1 up @NUM1 points. in conclusion I dint think that the computer has a bad effect after your done reading those I hope you agree with me."
4,"I think that it is fine that people spend a lot of time on the computer instead of having time to exercise, enjoy nature and interact with family and friends because it is the persons choice to either stay on the computer all day or go outside. Computers affect peoples lives in good ways and bad ways. People stay inside all day and do nothing besides sit there and just click buttons. Good ways is that it educates you in many ways because @CAPS1 your on the computer watching or reading interesting things you could end up learning something before you learn it in school. Its good to go on the computer for a little a bit but @CAPS1 your on it all day then you could have no exercise and become lazy and fat. But @CAPS1 you go outside sometimes you wont have to worry because you are getting exercise that helps out your body. I think computers are a great way to have fun. You can chat with your friends, @CAPS1 you have a web cam you can video chat with friends. A computer is a great way for communication. Millions of people use a computer for working at their @CAPS2. Without computers life would be ten times harder for people in this world. People like accountants use computer for there job. They store data into the computer to remember things @CAPS1 you couldn't write it down on a piece of paper, People also make websites on the internet to help educate, like @CAPS1 you type in a word it could give you a definition, People also make @CAPS4 engines, @CAPS4 engines are some engine on a website that searches for things you type in. @CAPS1 you type in something you will get what you were looking for. My whole point of explaining this is that its the peoples choice @CAPS1 they would like to be on all the time. Because computers and internet connections arn't free. It doesn't even do anything bad to your brain. It mostly educates it. People even go to school online they learn and study on things that are on the internet. Plus you could get @CAPS2 at places for working with computers, You could make programs, and anything you would want. So my statement here is that its okay to spend alto of time on your computer instead of exercising going to see friends and family and enjoy nature. I think that computers are fine and it doesn't matter how long your on it, it just depends @CAPS1 your learning and not playing games all day and being lazy and get fat."
4,"Dear Local Newspaper, I'm writing to you today to show how I feel on how computers have an effect on people. Computers have a very strong effect on people. Computers can cost people to gain weight, cost problem to there eyes and you couldn't pay bills. We all know that we all gain weight at some point in our life, and we can lose that weight. But if you on a computer for six hours a day you dint have time to cook a real meal. So what do you do, you eat alto of junk food. Do you really want to be the reason why someone is over weight? Picture yourself looking at bright computer Serena for six hour nonstop. Do you think that your eyes are going to be fine I disagree. When I really tried I cant even keep my eyes open and I'm pretty sure you cant say that your eyes are going to be fine when you just got looking at a bright Serena in the dark. Can you see yourself quieting you just because you say your going to work at home. But you dint do your work, and get fried, now how are you going to pay your bill with no money? Once your power goes out you have noting to do because you got fired all because of you computer. Now what are you going to do with your life? Well that all. I would like to thank you for your time. And I hope you agree with me for my three reasons you can gain weight, eye problem and how are you going to pay your bill?"
4,"You are the @NUM1 visitor, click here to get your prize! That is normal thing that will @CAPS4 up on computers, they can give you viruses, and people can get your personal infoermation. That is one reason computers are bad. On top @DATE1 that, ""@CAPS1 @DATE1 computers more than @NUM2 kids are abducted each day!"" says @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @DATE1 the missing child agency. They get abducted @CAPS1 kids go on @CAPS6 rooms and get themselves into trouble. On another note we rely on computers to much, it not healthy foer us. ""@CAPS4 up ads cause many problems,"" says @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS2 @CAPS5. More than @PERCENT1 @DATE1 people in the world have computers. This was from a world wide poll in @DATE1. More than @PERCENT2 @DATE1 that is kids. When kids are on computers they always click on the @CAPS4 up ads. These ads cause catastrophic problems! Peoples computers get viruses, identities get stolen, and credit card infoermation gets foeund out. Therefoere with those things happening you are going to yell at your kids, but you can't blame them they just thought they were going to get a free box @NUM3. Now that I have told you about @CAPS4 ups let me tell you about charting. Chating on computer is just a bomb waiting to be set off. ""@CAPS6 rooms are the main why. Now that I have told you about charting let me tell you about how people rely on them to much. Instead @DATE1 looking up what a book was about, just read it! Everyone thinks a computer is the answer to every problem when in reality @PERCENT3 @DATE1 the things on the internet are false, says Technology @CAPS7 a magazine that deals with the disadvantages @DATE1 technology. I remember when I needed to know if my flight to @LOCATION1 was canceled, so I went on Google and looked it up. The website I went on said it was canceled but later when I called the airport just to make sure it had been they said it took off when it was scheduled to! And instead @DATE1 an email just send a letter! Do you want your kids abducted @CAPS1 foe @CAPS6 rooms? @DATE1 course not, and do you want to miss your flight foer vacation? No I dint think so, computers are very bad and are used to often. No one wants their identity stolen @CAPS1 @DATE1 some @CAPS4 up ad. We need to do things on our own more often and stop relying on computers to do everything foer us!"
4,"Dear local newspaper, I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. It teaches hand eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Computers are one of the best technology invention yet to come that benefits society. First off, computers teach hand eye coordination. For instance if you're in a rush to type an amazing long essay you won't have the time to keep looking back at your paper, the keyboard and the screen. So you would need to know where these handy dandy keys are. However, if would be a lot more trouble if you didn't have any knowledge about computers are where the helpful keys are. Secondly, people would be able to learn about faraway places. If somebody wanted to take a nice, relaxing vacation/honeymoon with their beautiful wife they would need to know the weather forecast so they would know what clothes to bring, and how much money they need to bring to visit all the luscious, freshest restaurants, hottest stores in this enormous populated city. Without a doubt, I would love to take a vacation, but if it's going to cost a fortune I might have to reconsider this amazing trip. Lastly, you can talk online with other people. On blistering cold days and you can't go outside, or call them because you don't have phone you can MySpace or Facebook them as long as you want as long as you have a @NUM1 and only email address that nobody else has. Now it's time to decide! Do computers have a positive or negative effect on people. In my opinion computers are great for society and we should keep having them around because they teach hand eye coordination, and give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. Best of all, you will be able to talk to your friend and family online. This is certainly a great form of technology people should have."
4,"Dear readers many people use computers but, not so many people think @CAPS4 benefits society. Well, I @CAPS5! I think this because the internet helps you connect with people you're looking for. The internet also gives you the advantage to shop online. If you don't have a @CAPS1 system, you ca get directions online. If you read more you will see why I support these details. Have you ever heard of @CAPS2 or @CAPS3? Well in case you haven't @CAPS4's a social networking site, @CAPS4 helps you connect, chat and find people you are looking for. I have a @CAPS2 and a @CAPS3 and they're not that bad. They're actually fun. There is games you can play, quizzes you can take and you can chat with your friends. @CAPS4's a great way to find someone you know in another town or even. This is one reason the computer is a good source. If there is ever a reason you can't drive to store or where ever you need to go to buy something, you can shop online and buy @CAPS4! you can just type in the address of the website and look at all the stuff they have and click what you want and buy @CAPS4! They even have grocery shopping online. So next time your really upset that you can't go shopping, just shop online. ""@CAPS4 might take a while to get your purchase items, @CAPS4's worth the wait."" @CAPS5 you have a @CAPS1 system? well if you don't, don't worry! you can go online to a website such as www.mapquest.com. All you have to @CAPS5 is type in the addresss where your starting from and then the address where your going to. Then you can print out the directions so you won't be lost! Thats defiantly an advantage! So, don't you think that the computer is a definite advantage to almost everyone? Well I @CAPS5! you can use @CAPS4 to find people you need to find. you can shop online and you can ea sly in less than fine minutes get directions! That's any almost everyone should use a computer."
4,"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, Computers are a great invention that we have created. Some people are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and hanging with your friends and family. Wait I also agree but spending time on your computer can actually be a good thing. It can be a good thing because you can learn something new every minute, you can also interact with your friends on it, lastly you can do things at the same time hang with your friends and getting exercise. Every minute you are on the computer you can learn something new! For example, let's say that you are on a gaming sights playing a game and suddenly an advertisement appears. It will most likely give you know ledges about the advertisement you are watching. Also study shows that every time you are on a computer for at least @NUM1 minutes you can learn something new you spend your . Even way for them to communicate is via internet/computer. This way you can make arrangements. I know that spending too much time on a computer is not all that great, but these are just of the benefits from it so please consider this."
4,"Dear @CAPS1, I be leave that computers have a good and a bad effect on people. Even though I think it has both effects on Pope, I think that it has a better effect I think this because the internet gives people the chance to learn more about other places. Allows people to talk to family that lives far away, and it also helps to make new friends. I support the advances of technology. I support it because people can talk to their family that they can't get to see. I have three cousins that live in @LOCATION1 that I never get to see, but with computers I can talk to them all the time. We can email and @CAPS2 to chat to each other to find out what they've been doing, hows school, and so much more. My aunt loves to send and get pictures from them to see how much they've changed since the last time we saw them. Without the new technology we wouldn't be able to do that. Computers also help learn about other countries and the people that live there. With the internet you can find what the country looks like, what types of food they eat, what type of language they speak, and so much more. Recently I had to do a project in @CAPS3 @CAPS4 about a place in @LOCATION2. I got @LOCATION4, @LOCATION3 with the help of computers I found out so much more about the country that I never even know about. There were so many great places to visit and learn about the history of @LOCATION4. Learning so much about the place makes me want to visit there someday. Without computers I never would have learned so much about that place. Another great thing about the new technology is that we can make new friends and talk to different types of people from all over the world. I read recently in the @CAPS5 @CAPS6 that at least @PERCENT1 of kids have a MySpace or Facebook that helps them interact with people from all over the world. There can also be dangers to talking to people you've never met before. To be safe don't tell people your phone number or where you live. But meeting new people can also be good. For example, my cousin doesn't get along very well with the people she goes to school with. But after school she goes on her computer and talks to people that are just like her. Either way she should be careful. In conclusion, I must say once again that I support the advances of technology to an extent. Computers help you talk to family that you don't see, helps you learn about new countries, and meet new people. Thank you for your time."
4,"Computers and other devices are good for humans especially young people like myself because they are good for communication, keeping the attention of the and providing unknown information. In @CAPS3 letter, I will explain. Communication is key, and technology is close the best and fastest way to use communication. Cell phones provide calling usage of course, but they also allow you to text someone. If you have dinner with friends and your late, with text you can send them a message and they should get it in no time at all. Email allows you to do the same as text, but you can write longer messages. Something that's really good for communicating is video chat. If you have a relative that you haven't seen in a long time you can video chat and they can see you and you can see them. It's like talking to one another in person. Keeping a persons attention is critical. Technology does that with games, music from @NUM1's, computers, game systems and the newest way, iPod's and instructions on how to do something. Of course a teacher or parents can do that, but heaving or seeing instructions on a computer is so much more exciting, which brings me back to @CAPS3 topic of keeping a persons attention. Technological devices are more exciting than people teachers and definitely parents but do they offer more? Information is most likely the most frequent reason in which technology is used. If a child has a project for school, they either use the computers or asks their parents. If the parents have no idea about the question their child just asked, they say, ""@CAPS1 it up on the computer"", if you ha vent already done that. So in a way the human race depends on technology, actually we do depend on technology. Computers cellphones, iPod's, game systems, etc all include a little thing I'd like to call the internet. The internet has been around for a while, going from extremely slow to high speed, and it is a magical place. It can provide you with directions,recipes, job offers, store locations show times for movies and much , much more. Although technology is used in everyday life from communication to searching for information it can slowly us the human race down. I mean most of us spend most of our time on @CAPS2 or @CAPS3 @CAPS4 when we should be walking around are exercising, looking at the trees and the birds and communicating with family face ti face. Therefore, computers and other things are nice and all, but are the worth getting fat or loosing touch with your loved ones."
4,"I support advances in technology becauSEe In the future. Our world Willl be run by computers people can learn about places and people that they can never afford to SEe for real, and lastly, this helps to connect people to other people without talking to them directly. Have you ever thought about the future, I know I have, usually when you think future, you think nobody and lots of automated things. The fact is the world is turning into a pure run by technology and as we the people get smarter, so does the technology so what good Willl the future if none of us know how to work a simple piece of technology such as a computer, then how are we going to uSE the more complicated things then? Believe it or not our world within @NUM1 years Willl be run all on computers, you Willl not have to do untying but Will them. without computers, how would we know about all of the stuff that we know now. How would people know that Egypt looked like @NUM2 year ago? they dint to be there they could just look it up on the computer and how just as must about it as if they went there. Also computers enable you to learn about people that lived before your time. What president that you in something about how would you be able to find out after computer you could go to a library is right there to be Willl out computers in today society. Our average being would in at how does becauSE of the that computers have given us. I can whey some experts are concerned that are however, for some people this is the only correction to their Emily and friends it there is a family that lives lets say in a different country, and he or she wanted to talk to you, how would you go about doing that? I know that I would try to contact them on the computer. I love friends that live out of state and I enjoy talking to them so if we did not have the compeers that we do. theSE experts are saying that we are going to drive across the country to talk to them, if you ask me ht at is pretty tire consuming and pointless. In conclusion, I hope that you agree with me in keeping technology in our lives is important becauSEe of the future for people to learn nee things about places and people, and also to communicate with friends and family although I can SE your part of view that kids are not getting enough exerciSE most kids that computers are also involved sport."
4,"Dear @CAPS1 in@CAPS2, Computers are very help full tools in to days society and culture. They build cognitive skills and offer a vast wealth of knowledge. I want you to understand all the benefits a computer provides. First off, computers en chance our hand eye coordination skills. When typing, we look at the screen, while using our hands to type this becomes almost second nature after a period of time, proof that it is helping with this cognitive skill. Having good hand eye coordination is a critical part of driving, and many other tracks we perform throughout the day. Also, you must consider the near infinite amount of knowledge available on this tool. You can learn just about anything on the internet, and most of it is absolutely free. In fact, on websites like @CAPS3 alone, you can find a web page, dedicated to just about anything. Contrary to the counterarguments belief, a computer can actually aid in our social life. With instating messengers like @CAPS4 and @ORGANIZATION1 you can converse with people around the world in real time. Social networks like @CAPS5 allow your to keep your friends posted on what you are doing. Please take my letter into account, and publish it in your editorial. I believe computers help us with cognitive skills, learning, and socializing. Thank for your time."
4,"Dear the @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1, Some people say that computers are a negative contributor to society. In @CAPS3 opinion, computers have a positive impact on the world around us. I believe @CAPS4 gives people hand eye coordination and a way to be organized. Not only those but, people are still interacting with others. if you don't believe me now, read @CAPS3 details and you'll feel the same way I do. When you consider @CAPS4, computers give us hand eye coordination. there's no way to use a computer without typing. No matter if you're just typing in a short password or a @NUM1 page essay, you'll Elway have to type, and when you do @CAPS4 allows better movement at your hands. This can later help you in sports when you get out and exercise. Since computers have become such a popular thing, i think that in the future, typing or using a computer will be in the @CAPS2. this could be of the hand eye coordination @CAPS4 gives @CAPS3 theory is whatever you think, you type. in addition to hand eye coordination, computers provide organization which is a big concern in present day life. Do you have picture files laying your house? Well, there's no need to. With computers you store all and files neatly. how your might you can bark those easy to find everything becomes all that are locate. Even doctors are computers your medical needs and give time. Computers can give organize. Furthermore, computers continue to help instead with store say keep friends I can talk with friends or family far away. @CAPS4 keeps us together and gets I'm not saying that @CAPS4's Elways a good thing, because we all need face to face interaction. Although when you aren't able to get that, its a good way to talk. To conclude, computers positively effect our lives. We're able to get hand eye coordination, and stay organized when @CAPS4 can be a trouble to do @CAPS4 can bring people together when they aren't in person. You can learn about new things like people and places far away. though people @MONTH1 think opposite of me, i know that computers benefit society."
4,"Dear editor of @ORGANIZATION1, I am writ ting this letter to you @CAPS4 I think people are not getting enough exercise @CAPS4 they spend so much time on the computer and they are going to websites here are some things that I want you to write about so people can and @MONTH1 be aware. My first reason I exercise why this @CAPS4 so many people spent so much time on the computer they don't get they don't walk. They sit and want message their Friends @CAPS1 day. Not worrying that they are canning @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 A on their heart @CAPS4 of the @CAPS2. @CAPS4 of this it can @CAPS5 to heath @CAPS6 things could you can't do @CAPS15. m @CAPS7 reason @CAPS8 @CAPS9 websites to moral kids @CAPS10 @CAPS11 things they Are not suppose see when kids have free @CAPS12 computer excise the thing wen let me @CAPS11 this can @CAPS10 @CAPS11 @CAPS14 sites, gun sites, @CAPS15 to a things can make something they @MONTH1 really hurt someone or maybe even themselves.

My third reason chat sites Places to get some at tension They will @ORGANIZATION1 things they are not suppose to the @NUM2 year old man here some things to write are doing and please monitor them as much as you can to prevent this."
4,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Some parents are concerned about their child being on the computer all the time. Now I'm going to talk about @NUM1 good things about computers. @NUM1 bad things, and @NUM1 things on what you should do. One good thing is that you get to talk to people. You could talk to your friends online about something in school or whatever. Thats good because what if you fro got what was homework or you need help on something, you could go online and ask them. Another reason why is that you get to meet @ORGANIZATION1 people. For example @CAPS1 or Facebook. When you meet @ORGANIZATION1 people online they mostly come from a different country that you never heard about and then you just learned some thing @ORGANIZATION1 and you have a friend from @ORGANIZATION3, @CAPS2, or @LOCATION1. One more good thing their is, is that you learn @ORGANIZATION1 things online about anything. It could be a @ORGANIZATION1 website that you never heard about and something that can help you in the future. For example @ORGANIZATION2. @ORGANIZATION2 could help you out a lot. Now where going to talk about @NUM1 bad things that computers do. The first bad thing that computers do is that they make you addicted. For example me I got addicted when I had a computer but not I'm not we got rid of ours and now I just play with my sisters. The second bad things is viruses. My grandmothers computer got a virus off of a website that website was @CAPS1. When you get a virus it sucks you cant do anything or you can't look anything up for school. Getting viruses are not cool you have to wait a week or so before they fix it. The last bad thing is that you never want to spend time wit your family. I know some people who do that like its not cool if company comes over get off the computer. Since I dint have much time left I'm going to talk about one thing you should do. You should have a certain amount of time on the computer and go have fun and do what you want to do except go on the computer. Thats what I think you should for now."
4,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I took a poll of @NUM1 people and @PERCENT1 of them agree computers have a positive effect on people. Computers can help people talk to someone in a far away place, teach people hand eye coordination, and give the ability to learn about people or places. Using computers is a great way to keep in touch with someone. For example, my grandparents live in @LOCATION2. Some of the ways I keep in touch with them are emailing, video charting, and instant messaging. Some other good things about talking to people online is if you're talking to many people at once or if your parents are on the phone. Another good thing about computers is they are good at teaching people hand eye coordination. The ways of teaching this are typing, and clicking on something, @CAPS1 people, when they type, look at the keyboard. But, with prat ice, they will advance to looking at the computer screen while typing. To click on something, you need to move the mouse while still looking at the screen. That, believe it or not, is hand eye coordination. One last reason computers are good at helping people is it a student needs to look up a place or person for a school report, they can very easily go to google.com and type in who or what they are looking for. Another option is , say someone is going on a vacation to @LOCATION1 and they know nothing about it. They can go on the internet and get information on @LOCATION1 with just a couple clicks of the mouse. Finally, say someone wants to learn about @ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2 for fun: They type @ORGANIZATION2 in look at all the websites, choose the best one, and start reading. In conclusion, I definitely think computers have a positive effect on people for the reasons I have stated. People can talk to someone online, computers can teach hand eye coordination, and finally, people can look a person or place up using the internet. This is my opinion on computers, I hope you agree."
4,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 name is @PERSON1 and @CAPS2 writing to talk to you about how computers benefit society. Did you know that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 homes have at least @NUM3 computer in their home? Well who wouldn't! Computers let you learn more because you can research more, its quicker than having to go and look things up in the library, and with tools like @CAPS3 and Facebook you can talk to people you normally dint get to see. Computers let you learn more because of the internet. With the internet you can use websites like Google, @LOCATION1 and @LOCATION2. When you look stuff upon these websites and many others you can get valuable information that can get you ahead in life. For example, if I was looking up a chocolate chip recipe and I tried different things to make it unique then sold it, just think that life changed with one click on the computer. Also if I had to research a topic for @CAPS1 history project then I would go onto the computer, to Google and then type in @CAPS1 topic and be overwhelmed by getting the info that I needed and got an at on the project that's how computers help you learn more. Computers are very quick I can make @NUM4 PowerPoint's slides @CAPS6 with useful information in the time it would take me to go to the library, find a good book and write enough information to make PowerPoint slide: on overage @PERCENT1 of people turn to the computer to find useful information. When I was doing @CAPS1 social studies project @TIME1 I had to find out what the @CAPS4 flag looked like. So, instead of trying to possibly find a book on the library. I just hopped on Google and clicked images and clicked images and typed in @CAPS4 flag. Within seconds @CAPS1 screen was @CAPS6 with real and edited pictures of the @CAPS4 flag. It is amazing how fast information can travel from the world wide web to your computer. So would you rather be stuck in a library looking up information forever or out enjoying your life because you saved all that time by going on the computer? Have you ever heard of Facebook, MySpace, @CAPS3, or twitter? Well they are all great ways to communicate with people using the computer. When I am @CAPS3 or Facebook I can talk to people that I might not get to see all the time one of @CAPS1 friend from camp lives in @CAPS10 so I dint get to see her alto so with the wonderful invention of Facebook I could talk to her all the time. Just think without the computer Facebook would have never been invented so I would have most likely lost touch with a good friend. Also when I go on the computer. I have the option signing onto something called @CAPS3 or email. With this I can talk to people and get wacky emails. That would happen if the computer wasn't invented. So dint you want information to be easier to research? Quicker to find out information. And talk to friends more easily. Well lets make it @NUM2 out of @NUM2 homes that have a computer and help benefit society by doing your part and just getting what you need on the computer then enjoying life. Just imagine how much time you are saving by using the computer."
4,"What do you think about computers? I think computers have a very positive effect on people. All kids should have @NUM1. Please heed the following advice. Computers are a very good thing for kids to have. I teaches them life skills such as hand eye coordination, a lot about technology. Expert @PERSON1 states ""@PERCENT1 of success full jobs involve some kind of integration with computers, & if they learn those skills at an early age they can soon become experts."" Technology is a @CAPS1 part of life today, & will continue increasing with the years. It's a grievous idea to want to separate our kids from technology. As a child, my sister grew up with computers, she knew how to fully use it by age @NUM2, she went to collage with amazing computer skills. Today she works in a law Fermi as presidential secretary. She gets paid loads of money. Today she trays to get me to learn about all tech stuff. If you have kids you know you only want the best in their present & future. People say kids are the future, not if they re not successfully. Computers are a great way for kids of all ages to learn & communicate with @NUM1 another & others. We all want our kids to be happy. @NUM4 out @NUM5 kids use the internet to research things for @CAPS2 & projects. Kid therapist @PERSON2 says ""kid who chat, with other kids though internet like Facebook, @CAPS3, & MySpace are normally more socially interactive with other kids. I know you thinking there a lot of ""@CAPS4"" thing on the internet dint want my kids to see, conversely you can set limits & child block. & you also dint want you kids at risk of obesity because of lack of exercises. So give them time limits. My cousins each go on the computer @NUM6 hours a day. They do @CAPS2 & whatever time they have left they chat with friends. Its not all @CAPS4. As you can see computers can be seen in a very positive manner. Heed my advice & allow your kids the freedom of internet. They will be happier, trust me."
4,"Do you like your computer? Does it benefit you and the around you? People are saying that computers dint benefit people. I am writing to prove them wrong, and state why computers benefit us. It helps us with things like learning, communication, and even money or economic problems. First, learning is a very important in a lifetime and computers can help you increase that one hand eye coordination is very helpful in different sports like tennis, golf, and hacker too. When you go on the computer, you learn that skill. For example, last @DATE1 i went to tennis with mom and shes never on the computer. She missed every ball thrown to her. Thru computers all around the world, and going on the computer can open you to the whole world. You can see places like @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2, and even @LOCATION3. Overal, has the least computers out of the whole world. Finnaly, computers let you learn typing. In America, there are jobs that are for you to type. If you to type, then you a good job. If you get a good job, then you can be successful in life. Computers definitely benefit your learning. Second, when. Computers open you up met new friends. One, when you go to school, more with other student. Computers let you talk your you right. According to Facebook magazine, @PERCENT1 of all the students in a school chat and talk online to other person. Two, the computer can help you communicate with your family too for instance. If your her got hurt, could email that grandmas hurt. Computers can your family too. Finnaly, computer half in life. For example, kids with cancer, or even need to check them can let you talk to this kinds in. Computer very helpful when social life. Finnaly, computers help you. In that economy it's really hard to find a job. So the computer can help you with that websites online make you take a actually gives you a place to work."
4,"Did you know that @PERCENT2 out of @PERCENT1 children today, prefer to play games on the compuTer than do other activities? My opinion about this topic is that it is more important for children to do things other than sit on the compuTer all day. The reasons why I feel this way is because it is important to exercise, children Tend to be addicTed to playing on the compuTer, and if someone's life revolves around the compuTer than they most likely, won't be able to live on the ""real world"". When a child sits at the compuTer all day, they are not getting exercise. Today, obesity is a major problem. If people stay on the compuTer less and exercise more than this situation could decrease. Also, it is important for children to get fresh air. When someone plays on the compuTer they are not getting as much fresh air as you would outdoors. Lastly, who realize the importance of exercise Tend to participaTe in sports, to stay active and have fun. Once you begin to play games on the compuTer, there is not turning back. In today's society, children of all ages, become addicTed to the compuTer. Children who are addicTed pay no atTention to their surroundings. Also, some of these games might be inappropriaTe for younger players. Lastly, if children become addicTed, they could do poorly in school for refusing to do homework. If a child is constantly on the compuTer than they have a chance of not being prepared for the ""real world."" In the ""real world,"" you can't rely on compuTer games. Also, games won't Teach you things that you can only learn during school. LaTer in life, when you want to get a job, you won't be able to be accepTed because you will not sound knowledgeable. Lastly, when you are writing your application to go to a college, they will look at your records of sports and activities you've done in middle school. When they don't find anything, they will reject you because of your lack of participation. So when you are sitting at the compuTer screen, remember all the possibilities you have other than the compuTer. For example, it is important for you to exercise, playing games on the compuTer could make you addicTed and you won't be prepared for Te ""real world"". What is your opinion?"
4,"Dear newspaper, @CAPS1, my name is @PERSON1 and I believe that computers have a negative influence on people. When people are on computers all day they have less time exercising. They are in alto more danger, and they spend less time with there family. These are my only some reasons why computers downtrend society.. In more, more time spent on computers equals less time exercising. With the obesity rate rising no one wants to be unable to do regular activity's. With spending all your time on the computer, you would just be using to get over weight and unhealthy. It also makes many people feel self Cornish about themselves. If they dint have enough time exercising and keep eating they will become even more self Cornishs. More over it will bring more danger to you and your family. There are many places on the internet where you can meet new people. But how do you know if people are who they seem to be? If you spend more time on the computer then you will increase your chances by @PERCENT3 to get a personal assets, or even give you personal information up. So why should you take the risk? Just get off that computer! Even if you dint meet on internet aster you will still be glued to your computer causing it more likely to be harassed. I defiantly dint want that for my family. The last reason is the most important to @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 family. If you are spending all this time on your computer you will be out on in your family. This time is very important because you never know when your family will be gone! And it is a very scary topic to think about. I know that most people in @LOCATION1 was spend all the time with there family. On another note a survey shows that @PERCENT2 of children that spend time with there family and less than @NUM1 minutes on the computer have grades higher than @NUM2 in all classes. Wouldn't you want to make the hon nor role in your school? In conclusion, computers have a negative effect on people! Spending most time on your computer can causes less time spent exercising, more danger/harm to people, and less time spent with your family. Wouldn't you just rather spend less time on your computer? Thank you for your time."
4,"I think computers are very beneficial. There are so many uses! From learning, to games, to videos, and to a tool that is very useful. Without computers we would be like the @CAPS1 (@CAPS2 offense any @CAPS1 people). We would have to wait for a news paper or the news to come on @CAPS4.V. to see be calling news. Let me explain my reasoning in the next few paragraphs. First and foremost, there are lots of things to do. You can play online games, offline games, surf the web, chat, match videos, and so on and so forth. Without the internet I probably would have lost my interest in @ORGANIZATION1. I now am a member of the online community called www.MOCpages.com I post my creations, look at others creations, and comment, and chat. I use the internet to research for school projects. Right now, I am researching @CAPS5 @CAPS6 during the @CAPS7 @CAPS8. Normally I would have to slave over books to find something. Now it is much easier, because keywords are matched. Finally, it is a good fool. Did you know the military needs computers to store info, attack, keep record, and to pilot certain planes? I need to use a computer to type up home work, because as you can see, my hand writing isn'@CAPS4 the neatest. Also, I stay in touch with my dad, who works in @ORGANIZATION2. I hope I persuaded you on my position. Remember computers, do lots of things, help us learn, and they are a fantastic tool. Thanks for reading, bye!"
4,"To whom it @MONTH1 concern, To many people it is so much fun but then they become so obsessed that they can lose so much that they loved. My stand is that computers hurt peoples. Money, weight and sleep. My opinion is my opinion but I will stand strong with what I have. My father is favorite is the financial deal. With five kids and one laptop who would want to be happy. With people sitting and staring at a computer game all day the bills just keep billing up until you lose everything, such as your house, family, money, etc. But who cares about them when you are obsessed with your computer. My favorite is the overweight problem. Yeah I agree it is nice to sit in a soft cushy chair with your computer and bowls of chips and boxes of pizza but sooner or later all that fatty food will catch up to you when you least expetc it but will you get up and take a jog, run on a treadmill or go for a @NUM1 walk. Probably not will that computer game running. That wright will keep coming until you can't even move. Sitting at a @NUM2 will really have your eyes, brain, muscles and other important body parts due to lack of sleep and want for it. I can relate this to my brother with his dis. The be gets home, boom he is on it until maybe @NUM3 or @NUM4 o'clock in the @TIME1. Eventually he is going to get sick and I'm not to blame for it. When you sit at a computer than eventually you are going to make yourself sick and in some cases die if you were up that late. Now as a common teen to love to go on the computer but one thing I do not do is sit and watch movies or play games every hour of every day. I get outside and run so that I will not fall victim to weight. Financial, and body problems, like @MONTH1 people do. So don't waste your life on a game or chat room get out there and do something like sports or just get some fresh air."
4,"Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. They do because you can talk to others online, it allows you to get research done faster and they are much more efficient and easy to use i will further explain my reasons. First of all, computers allow you to talk to others online. Talking to others online can give you good communication skills and you can get to know different people. I always talk to my friends online. We talk to each other using web cams, inst any messaging, or talking on a social site like Facebook. Computers and web cams can allow you to talk to friends who have moved away or for relatives. Next, computers allow you to get research done quicker. Studies shown that @PERCENT1 of people prefer using a computer to find information for any type of paper than an encyclopedia or other book. Computers are much more efficient and easier to use than books. It can agree that computers are much more efficient and that i like to use them. If you use a computer to get research done than you can be done sooner than you know it. Finally, computers are more efficient and easy to use. If you give a person to coos from a computer or a set of encyclopedias, most people would choose the computer. Computers are so much easier to use than books. On the co muter you just type in what you are looking for in search bar a boom within a tenth of a second your results are there. Now, if you use a book or unclasped it could take several minutes to find what you are looking for, and then they only give very little information, unlike a computer that can give you millions of results for one topic. This proves that computer are more efficient than books. In conclusion, i believe that computer have a plosive effect on people. I do because you can talk to people online, it allows you to get research done quicker, and computers are more efficient and easy to use. I hope you will agree with me and my thoughts about computers."
4,"I think that computers do have a positive effect on people because they teach hand eye coordination, also give people the ability to and lastly they allow people to talk online. First, they teach hand eye coordination and I think that's good because when people get a job they can probably more focused and can probably work faster. So if people can do that when they get a job and their jobs involve working on a computer it can be easier for them and their job can be more enjoyable. Second they give people the ability to learn more because we have all these sites that involve information an everything so people can be more knowledge so if they're more knowledge they can probably get a really good job that pays alto. And they can look up whatever they like. So if they research alto and go to school they can get the job they always wanted because they know so much knowledge people are better people. Lastly they can talk to online people when people can contact each other its better because if they have no phone to reach someone they need to reach they got a computer that they can either email or use a web cam were they can see the person. I think that having a computer is good for all these reasons having hand eye coordination give people the ability to learn more and allow people to talk online with other people."
4,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 a place where they are all on computers all day long, everyday. I dint think computers are a benefit to society because you get less time exercising, less time enjoying nature, and you spend less time with family and friends. Computers are not a benefit to society. To begin, computers are not a benefit to society because it gives you less and less time exercise. And wouldn't you want to go exercise and lose weight. Other than just sitting around on your new computer and having your brain being wrecked out by it. @PERSON1 said that @PERCENT1 of people that get a new computer spend @NUM1 minutes more than what time they usually spend on it. Next, is that you could be outside enjoying nature. New @CAPS2 @CAPS3 Newspaper said that they are worried that it too many people got a good computer that no body would be outside enjoying what left of nature. Because sooner or later there wont be any trees left in the world and humans would became extinct for eternity. Lastly, is that you wont be spending any time with your family or friends. Like when I got box live, I couldn't get off of it. I was addicted to it. And when my family got our new computer, my older sister couldn't get off of it. She would spend all day and all night on it. Now, if parents take the computer away from kids they will have more time to exercises more time to enjoy nature, and more time with family and friends. Computers are not good toward society."
4,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS4 you think that computers have a bad effect on people? I @CAPS4. People spend to much time on the @CAPS5. When they need to be working on their @CAPS5 they get distracted and start to go and @CAPS4 their own thing. Other people sit at their @CAPS5 and get mad or angry at @CAPS6. When people dint know what to @CAPS4 they just go on their @CAPS5. When working on the @CAPS5 you get distracted. I am sight, People get distracted because they see that little Internet button cont of the corner of their eye. then they just click the internet symbol. Then their on the internet out doing their job. The internet is not the only distraction on a @CAPS5. The games are @CAPS10 distraction, @PERSON1, @PERSON1, and hearts are all game that came on the @CAPS5 People get mad or angry at their @CAPS5 because @CAPS6 does not enough @CAPS6 deletes a they need, or @CAPS6 simply wont turn on because its dead. They blame all of this on the @CAPS5: @CAPS6 @CAPS6 does not load fast enough the person might say, ""@CAPS7 on why use you being so slow I need to get my paper for work!"" @CAPS6 the @CAPS5 deletes the paper the person @MONTH1 go, ""@CAPS9 is the paper I saved @CAPS6! are you play a game on me?"" But if the poor @CAPS5 is dead and wont turn on then the person @MONTH1 go, ""why are you turning on you stupid computed"" @CAPS10, people all of their time on the @CAPS5. They are and con't find same thing to @CAPS4 they for the @CAPS5. Not the best idea I say, People in the @ORGANIZATION1 have act sets to a @CAPS5. At home, even on their phone. the @CAPS5 in the @LOCATION1 is becoming a problem in my eyes spending to much time on the @CAPS5 can lead to be over weight because you are going on the @CAPS5 in stead of going out and hang in with your Friends. in @CAPS11 I be live that @CAPS5 have bad effect on people, They get distracted on them at work. They blame them for thing the forget to @CAPS4. They use them to much these for people can stop going to gyms and get over weight. So @CAPS4 @CAPS5 have a bad on people? yes they @CAPS4."
4,"Did you know that the positive effects computers have on people the negative? I believe that the usage of computers increases one's knowledge of faraway places safety can be used for communication and can make everyday task easier computers have become the tools of society. Firstly, using computer allow a Floridian to learn about Connecticut's; or a Canadian to learn about the world around them. safely. In a by the @ORGANIZATION1, it has been shown that without the computer, @PERCENT1 of all people would have been ignorant of the one child dilemma in @LOCATION3. In addition, since the crime rate in @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1 is @PERCENT2 having co milted, an American might not went to visit @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1, @CAPS1, they mush learn about it for a business project. What do they do? They venture onto the computer and and everything they need to know about @LOCATION1, from the security of their home. While people can learn about faraway places from the safety of their houses, can also the computer for communication purposes. The computer is a great tool for communicating with other people. In a done in @DATE1, @PERCENT3 of computer users had some sort of social networking or instant mes aging program. Some examples of these are @CAPS2, and @CAPS3, respectively. being able to contact people has never been easier. Did you know that out of every @NUM1 Americans spend an average of a hours online ever day? So truly that the average I.Q has increased in the last @NUM2 years? When online, students can receive help from fellow students, teachers, and even experts! users of the computer can get feedback from essays, support to something new, and even boost self confidence. Communication is a great utilization of computers, as is the simplicity to perform everyday tasks online. In today's society, the computer can make everyday tasks so much easier! when I was a child, my mom spend hours in the local grocery, shopping for food. That all changed when my mother discovered @LOCATION2. It is a safe and easy way to buy food online to then have it delivered not only, but @PERCENT4 of Americans with computers have paid their taxes online. A once job has become simple, with the mere click of a button it is nerve wrecking that the majority of our day need not be filled with flooring errands, but what we want! Whether that be to exercise or simply enjoy nature. In a nuts hen, computers are great assets to society. They have a myriad of purposes and functions. They can increase a person's knowledge of faraway places safely, be used for communication purposes. and make everyday tasks simple. Its hard to even ruminate how we managed before this device come along."
4,"@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 there is alto of talking and arguing about computers. Some say they are helpful to society and others say not. As for myself I am one of those on the side of which is for computers. I think the do alto less harm than good. First of "
4,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 people have computers, and @CAPS2 people use them. It's been brought to my at tension that the government is worried about people using them to much. Well I think you can't use a computer too much. They offer so @CAPS2 things such as information, communication, and life skills. That doesn't too bad. Informaiton is something we as humans live for. Also in @CAPS2 schools and jobs you need to know a variate of unusual facts. Where can you learn these? Computers of course! When @PERSON1 (my teacher) gives us a research paper on Walt Disney, we use computers to find our information. With out the computer, I wouldn't know Walt Disney died before Disney world opened. That clearly shows one of the @CAPS2 things we need computers for. Communication is another aspect of our lives. With a computer you can have @MONEY1 ways to communicate. Yes some of these way can be dangerous but, @CAPS2 are safe. When I was in @NUM1 grade my teacher ms.casserelle set up a class wide email for us. This allowed us to email another school. This farm of online communication was perfectly safe. As long as the person using these forms of communication is responsible nothing can go wrong. Where can you go wrong with that? Did you know that @PERCENT1 of your life skills can and are learned on computers? As a attract your job involves a computer! One life skill you can learn is how to type. As I stated earlier research papers need computers, well it's not just for the information. You have to type them too. Most jobs in our world need the computer for something or other. Can you think of a job that doesn't require one at all? Ididnt think so. Information, communication, and life skills are all important to our human nature. Ithink computers are important to humans. Wether you admit it or not everything we do involves a computer to some degree. Can you spend @CAPS2 countless hours on a computer? Yes, but you need to. you need to."
4,"Computers are a huge impact on society, but do they make everything better? People spend way to much time on the computer. Computers do not help you brain they can make you fat and for a lot of people they cause drama. People should stop spending so much time on computers. Computers do not help you brain in any means possible. Think about it, sure you do alto of you work on computers but, what about your kids they spend most of their time gland online and doing pointless stuff. Instead they could be going outside or even study. the internet is open to the world so anyone goes on it and if your child is on the computer is exposed many vile things that will not help them in the future. Its a proven fact that the less time you spend watching TV or on the computer you get better grades. I remember my mom always yelled at me for being on the computer and getting bad grades so she took the computer away for a while and now i have much better grades. So being on the computer does not make you smarter. The computer can make you gain quit a bit of weight. If your on the computer a lot you are sitting around and a lot people eat while they are on the computer. So now you are sitting around the computer eating. That can make you gain weight. I know from experience that being active and going outside or exercising really makes you feel good. Once you gain all that weight it is very hard to get rid of it. Sitting around like a couch is not healthy. You can become obese. So you could say your happy with your weight but no one ever said it was healthy. A lot of people have died from being that beak. It puts a huge tall on you life. If you dint want to die from being to heavy then I advise you to get off the computer and go outside and live your life. The last thing that makes computers so bad is the drama they cause. Mose people have Facebook, aim, or @CAPS1 but if you ask anyone with one of those they will most likely say they have gotten in a fight through one of those. Also now they have something new called form spring which can let you be animus and people go on yours and just say horrible things. One of my friends was a victim in that and it ruins you. Also their are so many people on Facebook that lie about who they are and anyone can easily find out who you are and kill you now a days people know how to hack into peoples computers and get info. So computers can not only be unhealthy but they can be deadly. Why would you want any of those things to happen, when its so easy to just back on your computer time. Remember computers dint help your brain, they can make you fat, and they cause a lot of drama. So please dint use the computer."
4,"Dear local newspaper, I think that using a computer can benefit people and have a negative on people. Benifits could be, gaining knowledge, and meeting new people, bad effects could be, weight gain, and having a lack of social skills to talk with friends over phone etc. First, gaining knowledge is really essential. The I think that is because when your computer crashes or breaks you would most likely know what to do to fix it. I dint think you would want to have to pay money to get anti software that probably doesn't work. Anothe reason why I think that gaining using computer is good because what if you want become a computer engine re, all that time you've spent on the computer could really benefit you later on in life. Secondly I think that computers could help you meet new people from foreign countries and other states. Not you have to meet them in person you could just have a friendly conversation online. The thyroid and last reason why sometimes computers can be bad for you is weight gain. Most are probably so much time on the computer that there not getting enough physical activities. All they do is sit down eat on unhealthy snack and play games, and videos. That's really bad for your health. I conclusion using a computer moderately is a lot better then using a lot. It could help gain knowledge, meet new people or make you gain weight and have a lack of social skills."
4,"Dear editor, @CAPS1 you think that people spending a lot of time on the computer is good, I don't. People should GEt more exercise. Also they don't GEt enough fresh air. Finnaly they don't spend enough time with family and friends. Now we have to deter min weather people should spend a lot of time on the computers. Those people who spend alto of time on the computer could be going outside everyday to GEt exercise. Some parents got their kids hooked on playing on the computer all day instead of going out side to GEt exercise. They could ride bikes, scooters, play basket ball, waffle ball. They can also go swimming play, sports, and go to a play ground. Finnally they could go for a long walk on the beach. People need to GEt fresh air instead of being on the computer all day. They can go sit on the beach for AWOL, go outside to watch their kids play or watch their games like baseball or basket ball, or they can go outside just to be outsides. They can go sit on their porch to wait for their kids to GEt off the bus from school. Those people who love to play on the computer don't spend enough time with their family or friends. They could go visit their family more often, go out for lunch with their Friends. Also they can spend more time doing things with their kids. Even though there is a chat on the computer it is nice to talk to your friends in person. The time has come to decide weather people spending a lot of time on the computer is a bad thing or not. They don't GE enough exercise every day. They also don't GEt enough fresh air. Finally they spend time with their friends and family. So now you need to write a letter to your local newspaper telling them which you are choosing."
4,"To my opinion computers have a negative effect on people I think it has a negative because it causes people to get less exercise you spend less time with your family and friends and it distracts you from things get done. First of all computers have a negative effect on people because it causes them to get exercise. For example, there are many football, soccer and baseball games practicing these they will just computer on the web cam all night. Another way is that you can get work done. WIthout even leaving your house. You can shop online, stay home and work online, and even go to college those things include getting out around, but now you can just day and do those things and be lazy. Second, the computer causes you to interact with people less. Now, when family or friends. i went over my I sat right and she didn't even look at me playing computer games. i know that a lot more kids too because I was reading in a magazine that @PERCENT1 of interacting with their kids as much as they got a computer. Lastly, i think the computer has a negative effect because it them. It distracts kids conversations first of all when people to talk with someone on the computer it is very hard because, they are absorbent in they're doing. Secondly, the computer distracts kids from homework. I know this first hand, because wherever I have in type up assignments I get and end up going on different websites, and not getting my work done. lastly, it distracts kids from household chores. Some kids just put them to the side and forget to do them because they're Buddy playing game or surfing the web. i know that if I did I'd get in big trouble. Those are the reasons why I think the computer has a negative effect on people. Because, it causes them to get less exercise, they don't interact with people, as much, and it distract them. So unless you want all those things happening to you, I suggest you spend less those on the computer!"
4,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 have been com plates about computer in are society. They say they are keeping children inside doing nothing, but really they are helping us so much! The internet is where you can research anything and tones of helpful ideas come up. @CAPS3, @CAPS5 helps us with hand eye coordination. Lastly, computers Lowe us to stay in touch with people who are far away. Like last year my friend went to Poland and we were able to talk threw are computers! So lastly join me and help the world know that computers are good! First off I would like to say the computer is a good source of information. How would you like @CAPS5 if you still had to read scrolls from Green when you could look at on online? Not to man chin not any you need to know some thing really fast like now your stalk is be for a big meeting. Then all you have to do is sI'mple type in what you want to know then Baum! Just like that you know, and off to you meeting. Secondly, using the mouse and keys on a computer can inc less your hand eye coordination. Like my parents always say when i'm typing on easy, @NUM1 words per minute is a good minute. @CAPS3, out of @NUM2 kids get better hand eye coordination after getting good on the computer. Alot of tI'mes kids have a ten of coordination, but I have a that if kids on the thing will change. Most I'mportantly the computers and faraway like I munching be for I stayed in touch with my polish buddy @CAPS3, a lot of people don't have cell phones so they have an @CAPS4, gm ail, Facebook, my space, or a twitter. All of this allows us to stay in touch and keep us up in are friends lives. This is very I'mportant because if we are social the we will get out with are friends and do stuff, which is very I'mportant for are. In conclusion, @CAPS5 is good for are society to have computers in are lives. @CAPS5 will help us in the future, we will get good grades on project because of are sources. We will be Heath with hand eye coordination, from the mouse and keyboard. Lastly we will have many friends. thees are all very I'mportant in. So keep computers!"
4,"Dear readers, I right to you today about the effects of computer usage. I feel that there are some positive and some negative effects from using the computer. You can talk to people, and you can get work done, but if you are at this to much you'll be starting to gain bad health and miss other things in life. Throughout the computer, there is many ways to communicate with others, which is an amazing thing. Whether it be through a game, typing or real chatting, it's very important to talk to people and this makes things much easier than going out and talking to people face to face. For, example pen pals, over the years people have written letters to their pen pals, but know you can send it over mail and email doesn't cost any money, just type up your letter click a button and done. Another positive point about computers is that you're able to get work done on it. From work for a business to school work, it doesn't matter. You bear of people using computers to do work all of the time. Why do you think there are computer labs at school or desks with computers in offices. Computers have become advanced and the easiest thing to get things done with. Presentations, essays, graphs, anything. A concern I have of the computer is that people are becoming to addicted to computers. Many younger people are overusing computers which leads to bad health. When people sit in front of a computer screen all day only getting up to grab something to eat, people will because obese. To stall healthy people need to be outside and exercise. We need to make rules to keep people out in the open out to give the generation a healthy life. So, I have mixed feelings about computers. They can be amazing for a while but only for a while. And if you can't see this open your eyes"
4,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1 have effects on people and there life's. Cause alto of people as in children spend there time after school plan games, MySpace, Facebook and there email address. Instead of going on computers. I think that children and adults should go out and have good time threes not a problem with going on the computer once and awhile but if you spend all days on a computer then that's pretty bad. Adults shouldn't let there children spend all day on a computer and adults shouldn't eat her because it went help you life. Computers could mess your life up by choices you make and pictures you put up and things you write up there such as if you have a MySpace or Facebook and you put bad pictures up in you future when you want a good job they could just look back at that and say look at this I don't want this person working for me. and there you go messing up your future. instead of going on the computer all the time you could go outside do sports to keep your body health and go out in the world and learn new things or even plan trips to go on with your family walk around and stuff like the instead of going on the computer's and putting your self at risk of loosing job or messing up your future. You shouldn't let computer's mess your life up because if you do then your life want be the same children could mess there life up because things they wrote or pictures they put up witch other kids could see and be mean to them and talk about them fit the rest of there school year or things could lead to a fight over one little word you said or picture you put up because you thought it was cute. Sex offenders are on computers and some people don't even no it in till they get too kin away or killed. Parents don't always no when there is sex offender around or online talking to you or your children trying to go meet up with them. They also could put fake pictures up to try to get you to speak to them or to get you to meet them some where so they could take you. so you shouldn't let the computers get to you."
4,"Dear newspapers, I think that computers have a positive effect on people because you could chat online. There are electronics out for children that they can plug up to there computer and learn different stuff. And you can pay your bills on the computer. People that have no phone OD don't want to leave the house at that moment and have a computer can go on chat rooms or a local website can chat to friends and family. Also many people that have websites like Facebook, MySpace etc... can find new people and have so many things in common. And some people do find that @CAPS1 person that they been looking for. I think that they just come out with a new electronic for little kids like leaf frog that they can plug up to a computer/laptop and they can learn there alphabet, counting numbers, and even spelling, This is a goOD prODuct for little kids so they cam use the extra work over, the @DATE1 or after school so they can stay smart and learn in school and out of school. One day I had my mother what she was doing and the light bill so i was like how can you and she said and a website BTU I forgot what's it called and you could pay your bills right there. So instead of up going in your are go to a local show when thy pay bills and can like or if you get a computer you can do that in you home with no . So people who publish the newspaper I think and I hope you think to this is a goOD response that tells you goOD things about a computer. And I hope it sticks around for a long time."
4,"People are asking me, ""@CAPS1 you think we should spend more or less time on computers""? I say we should spend less time on the computer because children spend to much time on online games. Second kids and adults spend to much time on MySpace, Facebook, mam, and even aim. My third reason is children should be outside playing and exercising. These are my three reasons why we should spend less time on computers. My first reason we should all spend less time on computer is children play so many online games, such as @CAPS2 of war craft, @CAPS3, solider front, etc. A problem with kids playing these games become addicted to them, and will play for hours. Children should be outside getting bigger muscle, getting strong bones. Kids keep playing these games and are ruining their life's. This is my first reason why we should spend less time on the computer. My second reason why we should spend less time on computers is children and adults spend to much time on the following: MySpace, Facebook, twitter, aim, mam, etc. These online pages causes people to go on one to connetc to their friends. Also with these online pages they cause to much and could lead to fight or rumors. About @PERCENT1 of kids and adults go on these online pages every day its time they stayed going on their computer more time on outside or hangout with their friends. My last but not the least reason is kids should be outside playing instead of being on the computer. Children should go outside with their friend and play sport or games, something that doesn't involve with the computer. This is my third reason why children should not we spending more time on computers. As I said before people should spend less time on computer. Kids spend to much time on online games. Adults and kids spend to much time on online pages. And last children should be playing outside. Its time we put a timer on our computer and spend more time outside."
4,"Dear @CAPS1, You use a computer a lot right? Good if you @CAPS7 because @CAPS7 you believe that experts are questioning why @CAPS5 use them a lot? Well I think people need them because its how @CAPS5 know whats going on in the world, its how @CAPS5 know how the weather is like so accidents can be avoided, and you you can flip on your @CAPS2.V., but than you have to wait for what you want to go on. So you decide @ORGANIZATION1, should @CAPS5 be outside more? Don@CAPS2 you need to know whats going on too? Of course you @CAPS7, everyone does. I think that it is important that @CAPS5 know @CAPS4 a meteor is about to strike the world no? President @PERSON2 even says the computer is where @PERCENT2 of the world gets info. On whats going on. Are you just going to sit there and not listen to the president of the @LOCATION1? Don@CAPS2 think so. Im @PERCENT1 sure that @ORGANIZATION1 doesn@CAPS2 want to be known as the accident State. Well that's why @CAPS5 need the computer! For people to know if I will snow, sleet, or if there is bad traffic than @CAPS5 need to go to the internet to find out @CAPS4 and where and what time. CEO of @CAPS3, @PERSON1, says @CAPS4 someone says @CAPS5 might be getting some snow or rain than they usually go right to the internet  You you can turn on your @CAPS2.V. to find out whats going on, but not all of it you will want/need to know. So you will have to wait. The internet just does it right on the spot. No waiting involved! (unless you have a bad internet connection) @CAPS7 you think these reasons are making a good argument? I @CAPS7. @CAPS7 you use your computer for finding out whats going on, what the weather is like, and instead of the @LOCATION2? If so I think you would agree with me."
4,"Computers is a good benefit for people. First, computer is a helpful machine in diff rent ways, like I personally go on computer and check for my homework with it. Computer is also good because whenever you dint know something, you can just go on the internet and search it. Computers won't effect out health if we dint use it for a long time, computers could help students making project. By using word, ex ell and other Microsoft ware. So I think computers are a great machine for people to have. Secondly, using computer could also socialize with people, many students including me uses face book, so even if we are not right next to each other, we can still talk. Computers could be used to make new friends too, but their is people you dint know and we are not suppose to give out our information. said @PERSON1 our health teacher. Computers could be useful to friends that live far away, if your friend moved to another state, you could use computer to chat with him, their is many ways to social with computers. Lastly, exercising is important to everyone, but using computers doesn't mean we can not go outside and exercise anymore, maybe computers are addictive, but if you keep track of time and maybe use the computer for  half an hour at a time, you can still get the exercise you need. Exercising is an easy thing to do, children likes to exercise so their sold not be a problem, like my nab or Elway come over to my house and ask if I want to play football while I was talking with someone on the computers but I still went outside and play, so computer is a great machine that's not very addictive so parents doesn't have to worry about children exercising. I think computers have great effects on people, like going online to do a research or talk to friends. Grown ups need them to work. So that proves computer is a great machine."
4,"Dear @CAPS1 post, I have been thinking about the way computers affect our lives. Oh this very topic, I am agreeing with the experts who say people are sending too much time on their computers and less time doing other things. I do believe everyone, including myself, spends a lot of time online. Even if it was research, don't you think it would be better to stick our head in a book to get the information? The same thing apiaries to computer games, such as virtual kickball outside? The main reasons I am trying to get are computers hold us back, they are not physically able to help us, and going away from the computer, or even going outside would be better. I had mentioned how computers hold us back, the more time we spend; the more daylight we burn to do other things. I say this because instead of going outside. We want to stare at a screen and play games or chat with friends. Online chat especially has an effect on most people because were trading in a fun day for one where we just talk online and back internet. I also believe if we had a time limit on computers it is more a push to be social and go out and do things. Unforthetly, computers from that, and all we end up waiting to do is nothing. Another reason is that computers can't physically help us and make us active. I can to this one because I am a cheerleader, and I am constantly on YouTube learning how to stretch and do new things. Even though I learn and spend time to watch how it's done I get hurt and can't do it. Which is why I try getting cut more to a gymnastics teacher who can physically help and interact with how I'm doing. Lastly, I believe that the less time we spend would help us and be so much better. I know, after an hour or more online. I feel lazy and I don't want to do anything. However, if I go outside I feel full of energy and I'm active. Being off the computer feels better and is better. To sum it all up, computers are great to have, but to much of them isn't. It really does hold us back, and is worse for our health. Oh, and one last thing, too much time makes you less active. However, thank you for reading."
4,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Have you ever wanted to see the whole world with just a click of a button. That is as simple as just going out and purchasing a computer. Computers are becoming more and more popular. Some people think that people use computers too much. I am here to say that, that is a terrible accusation. First, computers help you with school work. Let's say you have an essay and it needs to be @NUM1 words or more you can just use word cant, then you have the exact amount of words. Also you might need to look up some information about a certain topic. You can just simply type in the word and search and then you have millions of choices to choose from. If you had a homework assignment that you didn't understand you could look up how to do it on the internet. But this i just the beginning. Another reason computers are so great is that you can meet and interact with people all over the world and learn their culture. You can enter a free chat room and meet someone from @LOCATION1. You would also be learning about their culture. This could also be a way to learn another language. If the person spoke fluently in @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 than he or she could teach you. You might be able to see how an @CAPS2 household runs. You could then make comparisons between the way you both live your life. Finally, you can understand the world around you. There are many websites where you can get a live satellite feed on places on every corner of the globe. You could also do research on the planet itself. You can learn about the care of the earth and what goes on inside it. You might also learn about nature. You could understand more about plants and animals. You can also got a look into space. You can learn about planets, if there is life on planets or water or anything else these would be things you can research. So to sum it all up, you can get school work done. You can interact with people all over the world. You can also learn about the world around you and that covers less than a fraction of everything you can do on the computers, but don't stay on all day. Make sure you go outside and have a great time too!"
4,"Dear @CAPS1, I have same questions for you and I was hoping you could answer them. I was wandering. Do you have any computers in your house, if so how many? Also, do you like using the computer? I am trying to figure out how many people don't use computers because. I want to ask them how do they survive without one!? Computers are essential to our present day lives. Everything in the world is in one computer. You can talk, email, even see people through a computer because now Adas everyone has a Vietnam hooked onto their computer. I want to tell you all of the great things computers do not make our lives so much easier. People are always looking for a way to get in touch with someone like if your phone is dead, how are you going to tell your friend what time your going to meet at that place? You can easily just text her from the computer. You can either use your screen name to text someone or just go on Verizon, at&t, spring... etc.com and text people from there. It would save you from standing your friend up and feeling guilty about it. Has there ever been a time where you needed number, but you couldn't find your telephone book? It sure has happened to me, but you know what I do? I go on the computer and go on yellow pages.com and just look up the restraunt/place on the website. It's as simple as that. You can look up almost anything on the computer, prices, places, facts, anything! Most of the time the true facts will always be there. Computers help you a lot if you need help on historical, scientific, and @CAPS2 facts. Computers help us everyday. People need them for communication, telephone numbers, or facts about anything. Most of someones life can be saved to the computer. If you have bad handwriting, then you could just type up your paper and hand it in all nice and neat. Like I said before computers are essential to our present day lives @CAPS3 reading this, I bet you'll agree."
4,"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 has come to my attention that some people have been concerned about using computers too much. Well, I disagree with this statement. I think the computer teaches you hand eye coordination. The computer also lets you up a leave more a foreign people and paces. Lastly, computers helps you communicate with others. As recently stated, I think computers are useful because they help with your hand eye coordination. For example, when you write papers for school or a document for work, you're using the coordination. You didn't even notice how once hang of typing, you tend to move faster. This machine is a beautiful invention please don't take @CAPS1 away!. The computer is also to everyday life and is very useful for learning new things about far away places and people. Another thing that you dint realizes when using a computer is that the you do from someone in your but from long distance places. How would you get that information without spending a ton on airfare or gas? The computer is the quickest way to find out information! Finally, the computer is an important resource because you can chat with your friends. A @CAPS2 researcher showed that computers You can chat @CAPS3, I think computers has affects on all! They teach hand eye coordination, they teach you about far away places computer lets you chat online with your friends! I @CAPS4 you see the computer the way I do."
4,"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 you know, the majority of people now posses computers. Computers have greatly advanced society and technology. Some people say that computers have negative effects, but that is not true. Computers have influenced people in many beneficial ways. Although some experts want people to use computers less, that technology is required in schools. Kids are fold to type their papers, which lets them finish faster. This faster finish can lead to kids not staying up too late. Then doing homework. That is better for their health. Computers also develop hand eye coordination which is an essential skill for later in life. In my opinion computers have greatly contributed to technology. They are letting explore place human has ever/could ever go. We can make and distribute item much faster. In addition, computers also let people learn about faraway places about different cultures and different people. Computers can expand everyone's horizons and let them know about places and things that they never knew existed. With are of the largest number of members. Facebook is a website that people use to communicate. More than @PERCENT1 of most students in an average school have one. They communicate there more than they could without computers. Computers aren't making people ""anti social"" or making them interact with friends less, they're actually talking more. Computers are letting people communicate daily with people from all around, without having to wiry about running out of cellphone minutes. Overall, computers are letting people broaden their horizons are lock of new things. They are more of a benefit than a burden. Computers are the next best thing since sliced bread."
4,"Dear Newspaper, I thought that I should express my concern. @CAPS4 are becoming to dependant on computers. @CAPS4 need to go outside more and be active. While some people @MONTH1 think were not wasting our tI'me on the computer. I @CAPS3. I'll should only go on if it is necessary. People are always coming up with @CAPS2 gaming ideas to draw people in, but what people dint realize is that is doe sent only waste there tI'me in waste our money too. Electricys bills are trough the rebuttals instead org going out to meet @CAPS1 people are staying home and talking on social networking sites which make them less social. Children are not enrolling in sports which makes them lose any physical strength they would get. Also children could be getting over wait by just sitting there with no physical activity's, @CAPS2 ideas like Microsoft word is fine but going on every day for games is. Teachers, parent, and all need to show these that the computer is not the only thing, Computers can benefit us very well, by letting us have knowledge of something at the tip of our fingers. Computers can and will take away family and friend tI'me. Now I'm not saying that computer but what am saying is that it effects everyone around you, @CAPS3 just the person that's using it. What @CAPS4 need to @CAPS3 is get torgether and unite. @CAPS4 need to go outside more, and exercise. @CAPS4 need to stop the computer with adults. Therfore, lets make this a better place. and get out and have a little tI'me for going on to the computer."
4,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 are several reason how computers have effect on people. My position is to con vice the local newspaper why certain people @CAPS2't and @CAPS3 use computers. People getting caught up on the @CAPS4, or people not having enough money to explore the world, so they just be on the @CAPS4. In effect, people @CAPS2't waste their time on the @CAPS4 because you will get caught up. For example, my friend @PERSON1 stay on the computer more than @NUM1 hours. He tells me that his on a @CAPS5 line, hooking up with other people. He for gets about everybody. He's so on the @CAPS4. He stop going school, he gaining. Now he just a nobody. He just sit in front of his computer and do nothing. I feel like he just threw his life away just for some stupid @CAPS5 line. @CAPS8's not hard to find another in our city. @CAPS8's alto of beautiful young lady's out here to explore. Similary, people @CAPS2't waste their time on the @CAPS4 because you start losing time. For instance, you spend less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. People stop losing their focus on important, and start paying attention on other things like the, was a great person. She was so successful. She make tons of money. Until she start losing her her job. She stop cause she was so stock on Facebook. Facebook is like a place for a friend @CAPS6 you could meet other people from different @CAPS7 you could just find people to date on that website. Facebook turn her life around. I remember her telling my mom how her life is so mess up now. How she got fired, how she don't pay her bill, and how she moving into a. Sometimes websites make lose focus on important thing in life. Consequently, certain people @CAPS3 use computer because the @CAPS4 help you with certain things. In summation, @CAPS8 help you find hotel or trip to go on with your friends or families. I love being on the @CAPS4. One time I sign up for this website that was called MySpace. For moment I did got caught up on @CAPS8. Continue line."
4,"Dear local Newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion on the effects that computers have on people is that more and more obese people. People tend to get moody. and it seems that computers are addictive. I think computers have a huge effect on people. The number one thing is that more people every year are becoming obese because they do not leave the chair they sit inside for most of the day. Also they get so lazy they don't want to get up so they will just order food and have it delivered right to their ha use. The next idea is that they do not get en ought exercise, because they isn't sit there all day and don't move. But when they do move its to get something to eat or go get their phone. This is why they should limit kids and adults to only @NUM1 hours or less of computer time each day. @CAPS1 next reason is because people that are on computers tend to get . Like one second they are happy and once they get off the computer they are sad. They get all coup ed up inside for the whole day. They don't see enough because people don't see they . If they hour each day the moody Bess would change. People need lot of exercise to maintain weight and muscle. @CAPS1 last recessing the computers have effects on people is that people will tend to act addicted to the computer . Like if they are playing a game all day and don't realize it they will get addicted and not stop playing all day. People need to leave the computer and do something else like ride a bike or play a sport. In conclusion what I am trying to tell you ta ht it is not good that people stay inside all day and play on the computer, because it is hazardous to your health and it is putting you at a high risk of obesity. So can you please listen to @CAPS1 ideas."
4,"Dear Newspaper, I have been reading about the debate about computers. People say that computers are teaching important skills. Others are saying that, ""People are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising."" @CAPS1, I think that people should be able to use computers (I mean they were meant to help us anyway) @CAPS2 think how much computers have helped the @CAPS3 race, from talking to friends/family in other countries too looking at what time the plane leaves to @LOCATION1. It is said that more one million people and up use there computer more than once a day. Without the computer there is no worldwide web witch is connected to everything in this world. Without computers you wouldn't be able to con troll any robotic or which will give more jobs but the cost of food to will go of tremendously without computers the equipmeant wouldn't work in hospitals computers can save life they store important information we would have to go back into the dark ages with typewriters again. Another big issue is that people are over using the computer. Once you learn to moderate the usage of your computer that wont be a problem. Some people say computers cost too much. There are ways to pot so called ""down paymeants"" on computers, something like a but you pay each month and setting up internet is easy as @NUM1. So, yes there are good and bad things talked about computers but without them we wouldn't have a modern era. Then con troll the robot that makes your to the that saves life's so with all this said I would lie to say thanks or listening and go computers!"
4,"Dear, @CAPS1 I am writ ting this article on computers to infirm you my opining on computers positive and negative effects. The reason why computers are so successful is because of some of the great information they. Such as directions to a place until you are going to or home information on a subject or a Pearson. Althoug these all sound good any one can post information on the internet so some information mint not all be ac crate. Some reasons why the computer is bud is because of signs which are not safe and can give your Pearsonal information to a and coming back to bud you in the future. Also we bite or pop up icon are not suitably for younger kids and exposing them to to mature for them. Lastly talking on the computer is apart of our everyday lives such as emails almost every American whit computer here. A email, this is a great to re lie or. Also the new souse of web witch giving you the ability to see people and into the computers which is rapidly growing in the @LOCATION1 @CAPS2 all in this article this you my point of view on computers."
4,"Dear locAL newspaper, I think that the computer is not a bad thing be case of three re sons one re son is that we can learn a bought a faraway place. Another re son is they teach hand eye coordination. The last re son is we can tALk to Friends and meet new people. From the computer we can learn a bought a faraway place if we were doing a report on it or just oUr of cUriosity. We can learn Watt kind of plantation grow there for food for example tropicAL places grow bananas and coca nuts. We can learn Watt they eat like in @LOCATION1 they eat many beans a lot of there food have beans even there sALads. We can find out there language as well maybe they tALk Spanish like in @LOCATION2. You can ALso teach hand eye coordination be case it involves using yoUr fingers and eyes to see what you are typing. You use Ur hands on every thing while typing weather you are typing or you are using the mouse. But it is not just for learning things it is ALso for Friends be case of AL these sites like MySpace, Facebook, aim, web chat. The possibilities are endless u can even play games. If you dint know someone on face, book, or MySpace that's okay it is a great way to meet new people and new Friends. And another thing if u are having trouble fin din Friend you can just see if they are online. It is good for getting together somewhere or something. And for those people who think it is taking away family time you can ALways just say okay that's enough and tALk to them. So that is it they are good because u can learn of places, hand eye coordination, and tALk to new and old Friends. so they are good"
4,"Dear editor, @TIME1 week, I noticed an article in the paper headlined ""@CAPS1 off the computer and go exercise."" This caught me off guard because there are many benefits to computers, such as it en chances education, you can learn about foreign countries, and you can talk to other people. Every school has a computer. Their easy access and very helpful. I know that @TIME1 year, if someone asked a question and the teacher wasn't sure of it, we would go strait to the computer. It also helps us do better on projects. I know I had to do a project @TIME1, and without the computer I wouldn't have it today. We also use the computers for the programs they have. In art, we made a cartoon, and made it look real with photo shop. It's also easy and fast to use a computer for research. You can also learn ahead far away places with a computer. For example, you can find out about other countries in the world. You could find out if it were landlocked, not landlocked, how many people live there, and facts similar to those. You can also learn the history about the country such as their leaders and government. Finally, you can also learn Upton minute facts with websites like @CAPS2.com. Lastly, you can talk with other people using email, instant messaging, and websites like Facebook, which allows you to connect with friends. With email, you talk with someone for business for to receives links to @CAPS1 to websites, and to @CAPS1 information. Instant messaging is just like testing on your phone, except much faster. You can instantly talk to people and catch up with them. Thousands of people are on Facebook. You can connect with old friends, and talk to current ones. I know my mom uses Facebook and talks to old friends since she moved. So, in my opinion, I think computers are a good thing to have. Not only do they enhance your education, but they also teach us foreign countries history and let us connect to old friends. When you were in school, do you remember your ""bestfriendforlife?"" @CAPS3, with Facebook you can catch up with them, instead of them being a memory."
4,"Dear @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS2 you know that eight out of ten homes in @LOCATION1 have at least one computer if not more? Computers help us with daily things and make many tasks, like writing an essay, much easier. They benefit our society in many ways. Without computers some families would lose contact with loved ones who are far away, not to mention it can keep many things very organized and neat easily. Maybe the best benefit is how you can learn about far away countries and cultures with the click of a button. Computers have endless possibilities to how they can benefit our society. Many people don't realize that some families can not be with each other so easily as other. If a family member is in the service sometimes talking on the computer is the only chance they get to communicate with their loved ones back home. Saying that this is not a benefit is a lie. For others who don't have such sever need of communicating it is still a convenient way to have a conversation with someone far away without racking up the phone bill for a long distance call. Also many times this can be an alternative to parents buying their children expensive cell phones. So having a computer is defiantly a benefit to comm uniting. The computer can also make many tasks much easier, for example if you were asinine a @NUM1 pages essay in school typing it on the computer would be much neater and quicker than writing it all out. Also many businesses relay on computers to keep data organized and all in place. Like the program excel, @ORGANIZATION2 created this to make a simple way to organize data. It is much more efficient than than having every thing in different site with millions of texts in every draw. So another benefit of the computer is that it can keep things organized and pride easy ways to complete Eve day tasks. Maybe the greatest benefit of the computer is how much you can learn so easily. Say I was curio use about the recent earthquake in @LOCATION2, if I wanted more information @CAPS3 head straight to the computer. You simply go to @ORGANIZATION3 or another search engine of your choice, type in the subject, one click, and Baum you could read for hours all of the websites and articles that would come up. The computer is full of information, and is right at our finger tips, this is definitely a huge benefit to our society. The computer is a wonderful tool that can assist in so many ways, weather it is communication organization, or just curiosity. This advance in technology is just another way to improve every day life. Computers don't just benefit our little town of @LOCATION1, they benefit our whole society in all of the amazing things they do. "
4,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 you can see, about @PERCENT1 of our population over use the computer. They should be out getting fresh air and spending time with their family and friends. On the other hand, the computer can come with much use. For many people. Family lives quite a distance away, @CAPS1 well @CAPS1 some friends and getting out of touch is a possibility. You can also learn about far away places, like @LOCATION1. The computer is often used for projects essays which is important. You can learn quite a bit with a computer. The computer can be used in many ways. One way is to keep in contact. Sure you can just go to the park and spend time there but not everybody live that close. For people who have relatives or even good friends who live quite a distance, a computer is what you @CAPS2. It is a great way to keep in contact. You can keep everyday updated at all times. For example, my cousin recently went out of the country for college she will be there for a few months so she has her own blog on the computer to keep everybody update and stay in contact. The phone is not always an option. To learn about far away places is great. Online you can learn about the history of specific places. You can see the towns and so much more. You can even see pictures. Maybe one day you will even get to see those specific places in person. How cool would that be? School is a big thing nowadays. Students have project after project assay after essay and its a lot of work. @CAPS1 you grow older it becomes more work and with a computer, you will have less weight on your shoulders. With essays you can type them, and fix your mistakes without it looking sloppy. Projects are easy to fix to: so messing up isn't a big deal. On the other hand, more Americans now than ever before are over weight. The computer has a lot to do with that. Most people will come home and sit on the computer for the rest of the evening. They don't realize what a big effect a computer can make on a person. More people should be out exercising. Spending time with family. Computers can be negative thing or positive. It can be more helpful than you could imagine. But, yet it can make a huge negative effect on people. It can help keep contact with people to learn about far away places, or even school work. Let it be beneficial, use it when you @CAPS2 it."
4,"Dear Newspaper, Computers benefit society because they teach people. They are also helpful because they solve problem that humans might have trouble with. They can also entertain us when we have nothing to do. They can teach people many things. They can help tourist learn about a location they wish to travel to. Actually @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 tourist research the area there going to on a computer. They help students catch up or fully understand something. One time I was having trouble with fraction, in math. So I decided to look up the way to find the answer and it caught me up with the class again. The computer can explain cultures from any where in the world. According to culture digest.com @PERCENT1 of people visiting a new country. Find out about the culture first. Computers solve problems that some people might not now about. It can solve a math problems easily with a built in calculator. @NUM3 out @NUM4 computer users have used calculator to help them solve a problem. They also solve geographic problems. There @MONTH1 be an about of date map but this is easily solved with live sat elite maps. Map tools says there has never been a flaw in their system. Computers have a wide variety of entertainment. They can play music. @PERCENT2 of teens get there music from the computer over a CD. Computers can entertain you with games. One day it was raining hard and I had nothing to do so I went on my computer and played minesweeper. This kept me very entertained. Please take this letter into consideration. Thank you for time."
4,"More and more people use computers but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Well, to me it does benefit society in many ways like, learning online. You can learn many things online, you can practice math, reading, and even writing. You can also have fun online if your bored at home and have nothing to do. Also, you can interact with frends and family members, by email etc. When your online you can learn alto of things. If your at home, and you need to study for a test, you can go online and study. You can also learn more, because you can learn how to do a math problem if you don't know it, or just catch up on reading. People sometimes need a computer because they might be bored, so they can go online and play games and have fun. People, especially kids get bored at times, so they can just go on the computer and play games and trivia's so they can still learn. Computers can let you interact with your family and f rends. You can email or web cam. if you haven't talk to someone a long period of time you can just go to the computer and talk to them. If you want to find a @CAPS1 school classmate that you haven't talked to in years, you can now. Computers do benefit the society, In my own opinion we do need computers. If parents do not want their child on websites they don't approve of, the parents can always block those websites. Computer are really NASCAR they can help in a huge way."
4,"Dear local Newspaper, In my opinion I be live that computers have helped our society a lot over the past decade or so. This is because when you on the computer you get better hand eye coordination. Also you learn how to type and do other things with a computer that you will need to no how to do if you want to get a decent job that pays well. Also now on the computer you can go on Facebook and other website were you can make friend and chat with other people. So its not only helping your social skills and hand eye coordination but also you are most likely to get a good job if you no how to type and use a computer. First off, having a computer teaches you to have better hand eye coordination. This is because when you get a computer having better hand eye coordination will teach you how to type better and more quick. Secondly, having a computer will teach you better social skills. This is because now alto of people go on Facebook and you can make friends and chat with your new ones. Also when its a cold and rainy day you can occupy you self by playing different games and also you can check the news and forecast for tom morrows weather. Lastly, when you learn how to type you have a good shot at getting a good job because you no hot to type and work a computer. This is because when you are looking for a job that pays good you will most likely have to me how to type and operate a computer. @CAPS1 in @CAPS1, in my opinion I think computers have helped our society over the years, but other people @MONTH1 think differently. So now lets see what you think."
4,"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 a family. Just a normal family whose lives have been changed due to computers. They are overweight, constantly suffering from fatigue, lonely, nature deprived and lazy. However, they could of turned out differently if they just shut down their computers. They might of healthy. fit, energetic, radiant, hardworking people if they had stopped spending hours on the computer daily. Although there are some positive computers can be dramatic. They isolate you from friends and family, they deprive you of the nature around you, and most of all, they @MONTH1 cause you to become overweight or even ob ease. Friends and family are two very important things in everybody's life, even if you dint realize it. By using computers rather than interacting with them, you are the connections you have. Computers @MONTH1 cause you to isolate yourself. They might cause you to talk to your . Unfortunatley, friendships can be . ""Spending long hours on my computer had caused me to become . made me fell lonely, @PERSON1, @NUM1, says @CAPS2, by the use of computers you are doing yourself a favor. Computer can deprive you of the nature that surrounds you. You most likely would be on you computer rather than going outside. Instead of spending countless hours on the computer, you could be playing a sport or activity. By playing sports you are increasing you hand eye coordination, far more then if you were to be on a computer. Wouldnt you like to be having fauns with your friends playing volleyball, basketball, swimming or even going rather then sitting in front of your computer? I know I would! The obesity rates of this country will increase if people continue to use computers. You will Rice about @PERCENT1 from lack of exercise. Computers can ruin lives by increasing your chance of becoming unhealthy overweight. So now think, would you want to be lonely, overweight, and deprived of nature? I know i definitely wouldn't. why computers should be used less frequently! So hows the time; lets join together and raise awareness of the negative effects of computer!"
4,"Dear local newspaper, I am here today to state my reason why I am against usage of computers. My @NUM1 reason why I am against usage of computers is, the negativity, like for example too many pop ups come on the website your own and then they mini little advertisements like ""@CAPS1 on me"" ""free trial"". And that's not good for children to see when they are using the computer. My second reason why I am against using computers is who's online when your up there. @NUM2 out of @NUM3 people use the computer every single day and @NUM3 out of @NUM5 people be up there chatting with young little girls and boys. And they older what then what they say. What I'm trying say is these people are called ""@CAPS2"". These people roam through the internet day and night trying to find little boys and girls. Just like I say earlier that's not good computer usage. The purpose of getting on the computer is look for information or play games no that other stuff. My final reason of being against computer is monitoring, alto of parents dint watch their kids when they are on the computer, so most of the kids look at a lot of incorporate sites or things that they shouldn't look at. And that be their fought because they should have parental lock up there. In conclusion, basically what I am trying to say is computers can be dangerous sometime because you dint always know what your clicking on and you can @CAPS1 on the wrong thing and end up on a site that you don't want to be on. So just have my opinions and maybe you can understand what I'm trying to say. Thanks."
4,"@CAPS1, @CAPS1 boom, bomb! Those are the noises of pinball on my computer. @CAPS2! Yea we won"". Those are noises you don't want to be hearing all day. Always being on your computer is bad for your health. @CAPS5 you are a computer freak you will become over"
4,"Currently, there has been a debate on whether or not computers benefit society. Some people, say that computers enable internet conversations between friends, and computers pass off information about faraway places and people. However, I tend to believe that the computer is not necessary. People exploit most of their time on computers, reducing their exercise time. Not many pay attention to nature, and instead of talking to friends in the internet, why not meet them at the park? Many people who use their computers reducing their metabolism. This is one reason why the @LOCATION1.A has the highest obesity rates in the world. In addition, the less you exercise, the less healthy you will be, and the more pair you'll receive, you will feel more tense if your muscles are not exercise. If we, as @CAPS1, continue to lack exercise, there won't be many possibilities for us in the future. Isn't it difficult to know that people pay too much attention to the computer when there are endangered species in nature? Pandas! polar bears, whales of different types, and other creatures all need our help to fight this extinction problem. Unfortunately, we pay much of our attention on the computer, with consideration, as humans, we make things possible, so we should help creatures in need to survive for generations. Perhaps we @MONTH1 learn more about these creatures if we take time off of the computer to do so. Perhaps we will find nature more interesting. Why do we have text messaging in our computers if we have the ability to talk to our Friends in a park? We have the freedom of speech in the @LOCATION1. Our families need help occasionally, but sometime we're not available. While reducing our social life, our computer hours are becoming more important, and are distracting what's mos important. In conclusion, computers hours, you must think about what can be done for nature, for your health, and for your family and friends."
4,"Dear editor, I have heed about me advance in technology dispute. I would like to say their I think it does beef it our society. I think this because: You can communicate with friends, they help you with school and a reliable resource for you need to find. Please read on so I can explain my reasons. Computers and technology beefit us in many ways. One of mom's they able you to talk to friends. Computers give you an easy and fast way to communicate with others. Instead of sending a boring letter that takes forever to get there, you can hook up with your friends, you haven't seen in a while. I remember when my friend moved to @LOCATION1. It would of taken me forever to there, so instead I went online and talked to him. Als, lastly, it less your hand. Now please read on for my second reason. My second reason . Computer are a of looking in many different take days. You can go online and find everyone, in ten minutes. In fifth grade I had to do this really hard project. I looked in books @NUM1 days and find. But then looked up everything I needed to known in an half hour. Lastly, they have more success. If you go on in @ORGANIZATION2 you could find hundreds of on one topic. Easy right? New read on for reason. My last and strongest reason that technology can help you find anything in everyday life. Computers can help you find your way. They supermarket for you. They can help with anything. One year I went on vacation to @LOCATION2. my mom move. So got lost help. Na, if we gotten difference have nevi pickle. Wouldn't you be more confident if you had ? Computers can a ls find for places for you an your friends or family to have fun like it couldn't find places never heard of. Such as @ORGANIZATION1. Now need on so can all up. So, as you can see technology, beefits our society in a big way. Mostly in these three reasons: You can communicate with your friends, they help you in school, and they are a reliable source for everybody life. i hope you have enjoyed Reading this. Please take this info your next . thank you for your time, and thank you for reading my paper."
4,"Dear @PERSON2  @CAPS1, I strongly suggest that people do not spend as much time on computers as they do cogently. People will be doing much better things, such as exercising or spending more time with family and friends. Both these things are better for people's body and mind, and one more useful later in life. Please consider the following about why it will be more beneficial @CAPS2 people do not spend as much time on computers. First, exercising is an excellent alternative to sitting at a computer screen. A recent study by @ORGANIZATION3 and the @ORGANIZATION1 studies found that an average person spent five hours per day on the computer. By cutting out at least some @ORGANIZATION1 these hours, people will be able to make time for more exercise in their daily routine. Also, @PERSON3 at @ORGANIZATION4 says that ""@PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 people do not exercise enough in the @LOCATION1 alone."" @CAPS2 some free time being on the computer is taken away, people will reward them self by taking care @ORGANIZATION1 their bodies. Moreover, I tried not using my computer for a week, and it was a great experience because in that free time I learned how to do a back flip in gymnastics. There are so many possibilities in exercising @CAPS2 people do not use their computer as much. Second, @CAPS2 people do not spend as much time on the computer, they get more experience with social skills. For example, @PERSON1 at @ORGANIZATION5 says ""@CAPS2 people spend time with family and friends, they gain necessary social skills for later in life."" A study at @ORGANIZATION2 showed that people who spend three hours or less on their computers have up to @PERCENT2 better social, verbal, and quick thinking skills. Spending time with people's family and friends in stead @ORGANIZATION1 on the computer is extremely beneficial. I try to spend at least three hours a day spending time with family and friends and I have good relationships with them. Clearly, it is better to spend less time on the computer, and more time exercising or spending time with family and friends. Some people @MONTH1 say people can talk to people online so this is social skills, but in fact people gain better social skills from postseason interactions because they must use quick thinking and their emotions too. Altogether, I strongly believe spending less time on the computer is the best way to stay Heath mentally and physically. Thank you for considering my opinion."
4,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 recently has been brought to my attention that computers have been affecting peoples daily lives. i do agree with this because with our countries of obesity. More people need to exercise more, interact with Friends, and to just enjoy things that don't involve technology. Some people are just super glue to computers, but let's see if @CAPS3 doesn't start wearing down after this paper. Many individuals are spending too much on their computer and less time working out or exercising. People need to start spending more time on exercising and less time on their computer due to the facts that more and more states obese percents just keep rising. Yes, you @MONTH1 say I will just go on a diet ion! Diets don't always work and many people have tend them. Even a simple one hour walk with your dog is better than lazily browsing the web. And if you wanted, you could even join the local gym for @MONEY1 a month. Buttle only way this is going to happen is by you wanting to do so. Now you know how to fix your problem, get going! More people need to interact with friends instead of going on their computer. Interacting with friends or family will help the mm be better with their social Hus in all. Yes, maybe your friends and family out and hungry with your friends most likely you will have more fun exercising then you have on the computers. By interacting with friends and family will help yon later in life by being more social and ready any job interview to meet you less nervous. F in ally, enjoying things that don't involve technology is good to know because many people don't have as much fun out in the real world. You have to mete @CAPS3 fun. This can be severed by as ting a Friend to go on a comp trip with yup or spending a little dough to enjoy yourself. The our doors and nature consists of many beautiful and awesome things; but the only way to realize this id to have fun outside or explore whats the great tour st. In conclusion, many people's lives are being manipulated by computers and destroying their daily live. but maybe due to these easy tips; excusing more, by soul."
4,"The use of computers has been increasing since personal computers were invented. Although there are some upsides to computers like doing research and interacting with people, there are @CAPS1 more bad aspects then good ones when it comes to computers. Computers negatively affect the way people live outside the ""virtual world."" @CAPS1 people end up overweight or obese from spending too much time in a computer chair and not enough time outside exercising. People also tend to interact with people on the computer Thait they don't talk to out in the world, or Thait they don't know at all. People also give out personal information to people they don't know, which leads me to my second point. Thefts happen everyday across the globe, whether it's robbing a bank, a store, or even someone's identity. Using a computer can lead to @CAPS1 thefts. There are people Thait hack into people's banking account, which has all your personal information on it, and withdraw any sum of money Thai they like. Millions of people have all of their information online, for anyone to see, and this is very dangerous. That is another downside to computers. My final point Thait is to be made is all the costs Thait come with computers. @CAPS1 people have to spend a lot of money on glasses because they looked at a computer nearly all the time. Some people even must pay for rehab. There are people out there who are actually addicted to the internet, so they have to pay thousands of dollars to get back to health. As you can see, there are @CAPS1 more cons Thain pros when it comes to computers. Any of these things could happen to you so I advise you not to use a computer."

4,"Dear local Newspaper, This Ara are all about computers. Computers @CAPS1 a benefit to have. It increase the hand eye coordination, talking skills and easy knowledge. My first paragraph @CAPS1 about hand eye coordination. This @CAPS1 a important skill because it helps with physical movements, using your hands for example. Studys have shown that @NUM1 out of the @NUM2 have improved hand eye coordination. Also it help kids @CAPS1 that it stimulates the nerves in the hands and brain for kids that have had surgery on there hands. Last years study has shown that @PERCENT1 of kids have improved hand movement faster than regular therapy. Secondly. The importance of computers have been commutation like email or aim. This @CAPS1 great for pen pals because it saves time for responses from mail and money because there @CAPS1 no mailing to places and when you email them there will be a fast res ponce. Also this will help people that are shy around people. A study has shown that @PERCENT2 of shy kids have increased the talkative skills in school. Also most talkative skills will help kids today with there confidence. Finaly, the computer @CAPS1 a helpful knowledge tool to use. Most book will be more challenging to find because there @CAPS1 all ways extra information that @CAPS1 not needed and will take longer to find. With a computer all you need to do @CAPS1 to type in what info your looking up. ""@CAPS1 an easy sensation"" said time magazine. That was one great comment from time. In school however there are helpful tips that are making it eager and easy er to find with bookmarks that you can find that are faster because all there @CAPS1 to do @CAPS1 go up to bookmarks and find the web sight and click and that's it. In conclusion the ERA of computers are becomingly more popular by the hour. And the benefit of the computer like hand eye coordination, talkative skills and more and easy knowledge."
4,"Dear Newspaper, I disagree that computers are important to people because they have research, online colleges, and online stores. Those are my top @NUM1 reasons and I'm going to give more details. My first main idea is that computers help students find important information help students find important information on a project. You can do on the Wikipedia to help find information about the battle of @LOCATION1 and other important history. one example is I went to American history.com to find good information about @CAPS1 alley @CAPS2 and what happened there. People also look up a lot of stuff that involves school. You can get research about the earth and what happens to it. My second main idea is that computers are good for people is when you finish high school, you can go to college. Some colleges can be found on the internet and you can go to college at home on your computer. One example is my cousin. She goes to college on the internet because she has to take care of her two children. Whenever you watch television you see a commercial about online colleges because they are trying to tell you to go to school online. My third and final reason why computers are good for you people is that some stores have an online store where you can look at what they have in the store. Children like to go shopping alto but they can't go to the mall or the stores because you don't want to go. You can let them see what they want and buy it online than going to the stores. It can be shipped to your door without going anywhere. My mom sometimes orders from @CAPS3.C @CAPS4 so she doesn't have to go there. It gets shipped to our house in less than a week. There was my @NUM1 main reasons why people should have a computer. They can find research, online schools, and online shopping stores. This can help people understand computers."
4,"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 you know that more than half the students in the world use the computer to study. I think that people don't spend a lot of time on the computer. And even if they are it's for studying learning of catching up with old friends. Here are some reasons why I think that computers have good effects on people. Most kids use computers to learn about things they are doing in class. And they also use the computer to study about a country or a person they are doing a report on. Also there are games on the computer that can help you with math. Now onto my second reason. You can also use the computer to send emails to friends that live faraway, and also you could use things like Facebook to find friends that had moved away. And you could also use a video camera to video chat with a friend or if you are a business man or woman you could video chat with clients all across the country. Now onto my third and final reason. Computers also have applications like Microsoft word which lets you type things such as essays or term papers instead of having to write them out by hand. Also there is an application that lets you make a PowerPoint if you need to make one for a project. And there is an application that lets you paint pictures or draw pictures. Those are some reasons why I think that computers have good effects on people. If we didn't have computers the world would be very different like kids wouldn't be able to search things for projects or type essays. And you wouldn't be able to keep contact with someone who moved away. Also you wouldn't be able to make power points for projects. And that is why I think computers have a good effect on people."
4,"Dear: @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I think computer are one of the most @CAPS3 inventions ever. They help education make everything @CAPS4 and traveling is @CAPS4. It helps education because @CAPS5 always use computers to help kids learn important information. for example if we have to study for something there are websites specially made for studding. Also there are sites to teach little kids how to read or write. Allmost all @CAPS5 have computers these days. Some @CAPS5 even give computers to kids so they can use it to study. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS5 in the @CAPS7.S use computers more than textbooks and get high test scores. Thats why computers help education. A second reason is it generally makes everything @CAPS4. For example instead of writing an essay for school and having it take hours than your hand is and to find out its filled with miss spelled words. Instead you can type it quick and use spell check. I have never heard one person say that the computer hasn't make life @CAPS4. Another example is if you had to find some information on you new dog. Instead of go ind to your library spending minutes.You can simply open up you internet and then search it and find the info you need in seconds. That's why the computer make every thing @CAPS4. The last reason is that one. Traveling is such a without a computer With out it you have to go to to buy tickets. In fact I don't even remember what it was like to not @CAPS9 online with a computer all you have to do is go to the parts websites and then but it from there its so easy aerosols to places but traveling mail to each other also. I haven't sent a @CAPS8 card in years. Instead I @CAPS9 email. It quicker, @CAPS4 and more reliable. That is why travailing people and mail is @CAPS4. Over all the computer is one of the most helpful things ever and with technology upgrading daily soon it will be even @CAPS4 to do things. While too much computer is bad and people souldn't @CAPS9 interact with internet. The computer games in handy almost all the time. That is why i think the computer is @CAPS3."
4,"Dear, @ORGANIZATION1. There has been lots of talk and arguments about computers and weather they benefits the society. I be live it does benefit society. One re son is because you can communicate with others. Another re son is theirs many things to do on these computers or even the world wide web. Haveing computers is always handy. You can talk or web chat with friends. This one time online I found my old friend from @LOCATION1, that I haven ed seen in five years. Whenever I come home from school I'll go on the computer and talk to all my friends. The computers a great place to make plans or to catch up with some buddies. My next re son for why they benefit society is theirs so much to do. It's like an at home amusement park. The internet is a wonder full thing. either to do home work or play games. even some @ORGANIZATION1 I'll just sit down for two or three hours and just play a game. But, i still exercise daily. yes, computers can get addicting but, its always good to go outside and exercise. Many people say over @PERCENT1 of the @CAPS1. population has a computer, and @PERCENT2 check email or go on the computer every ten minutes. yes its not Heath but its their dissuasion. In conclusion I be live computers are indeed beneficial. I have stated many re sons why. such as, They are great for communication or @CAPS2 up with some friends, also theirs an infinite amount of things to do. So if you don't have a computer go out and get one. They will be worth your wild."
4,"Computers are the future. Computers are the best technology we've created. They allow us to improve our hand eye coordination, learn about faraway people and places and what with our friends. Computers improve our hand eye co ordinations typing is a good way to improve this vital skill by not looking and knowing which buttons are where. Using a mouse is also a good to improve by moving the digital mouse with the one in your hand. This can improve foster writing, because you are moving the friend in your hand the same way you would move a mouse or type. This can also help driving, because you can't look at the wheel, you have to keep your eyes on the word, and in order to do that you most know how you're moving the wheel. Computers can help hand eye coordination which can help with writing and driving, with typing and and moving a mouse. Computers can increase our knowledge about faraway places, and people. Cultures come in a variety we can learn about all of them from the comfort of our own home. We can also learn about nature from our home. Learning about different cultures can teach us many things. Like what kind of clothes they wore, food they ate, place the, lived in. This allows us to change our own culture by getting inspired from others. Learning about new places can help broaden the mind about other spots in the world that can lead to a vacation. Lastly, computers allow us to internet with friends from our chairs. Chatting, and emailing and video chatting are all great ways to interact. With a web cam you can even see the other person as if you here facets with them. You can also email important files, such as pictures, documents, and even videos. This can help with someone's job. In conclusion, computers can teach us hand eye coordination, can teach us about faraway places and people, and lets us interact and share with friends. Computers are a very important part of my life."
4,"Dear @PERSON1, @CAPS1 you know that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 spend to much time on their computers. I be live people should spend more time outside with their family. This can certainly lead to brain problems, hard time seeing and the biggest thing is death. First of all there are people with brain problems because they are on the computer to much. When they are out with their family they think of their computer. People stay on their computer for a nonstop amount of time. In a resent survey it showed that teenagers stay on the computers the most. Most people don't have a life outside their computer room. Most of all eye doctors have been getting call from parents. They are worried that their child/children have a hard time seeing. I interviewed an eye doctor and this is what he had to say, ""I had one child come into @CAPS3 office and he had the hardest time seeing"". He asked the kids mother why is he having a hard time seeing and she said, ""@CAPS3 son spends on average of three and a half hours on the computer."" The child had to get a pair of special glasses so that he could see better. These glasses are really expensive. I have read about children and adults deign from using the computer to much. They have fried their brain from using the computer to much. Their brain tells them to do things that are illegal. For example: breaking in homes, killing people, and high sacking cars. I heard one kid used the computer to much that he started to kill people and got shot by a cop. The more people die from using the computer to much the higher the death toll will be. It is now or never @CAPS3 friends out there to work together on cutting down on how much we use the computer. I'm sure that no one wants to be part of the death toll until we really have to. It is time to go outside and have fun with your family. They miss spending time with you. So get off your butt and go outside. But wait, make sure you turn your computer off so that you are not tempted to go back on it."
4,"To the @CAPS1, I have recently heard that some people think that computers don't benefit society. However, I disagree with that. First, it allows children and adults to learn about distant places and other things. Also, it allows family and friends to connect with other family and friends. And lastly, it is a form of entertainment on a day that you can't go outside. Some people might not agree with me. However, I believe the computer wasn't a waste of thought. I think the computer is a benefits to society and the whole world. First, the computer allows children and adults to learn about distant places and, other things. People, professors, historians, and either highly educated people past discoveries and information about things everyday. That means everyday someone can learn something everyday of their life. When I do research on a important person in history, I learned things I never learned in school. The computer is the best way to allow people to put info they've learned for other people to see and gain knowledge of each other these are endless possibilities for everyone who owns a computer to learn. You wouldn't believe the things you can learn on a computer. Also, the computer allows family and friends stay in touch with other family and friends in far away places. If there was computers and some of your family moved to a diff rent. There wouldn't be an efficient way to stay in touch with them. The computer allows you to send email to a families computer or cellar phones. The computer is the best way to stay close to your family even though they are far away. My brother is in @LOCATION1 and every day I get on the computer when I get home and video chat with him. If there was no computer, I wouldn't be able to chat with my brother. Lastly, the computer allows a form of entertainment on a rainy day. Certain software gives people the chance to create games and post online to the public. When I can't go outside because of the weather I get on my computer and play video games. The games keep me company. I can never play with other people with online multiplier. Some of the games are educational also. The games teach you different things about history. "
4,"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you know that over @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 own computers? Computers are one of technology's greatest and are sweeping the nation, as well as the world. As you can probably tell, I believe that computers have positive effects on people. Computers teach hand eye coordination and create the ability to learn and research quickly and efficiently. And don't forget get that they offer ways to chat online. Have you ever played a game of baseball where you just can't seem to just hit the ball? Well, sounds like you need to work on your hand eye coordinator. Studies have shown that @PERCENT2 of people that use computers have an increased hand eye when doing activities like sports or games. So if you use a computer, you'll be hitting home runs, not striking out. After you've won your baseball game, it's time for homework, and guess what? Your teacher assigned a project that's due tomorrow! Don't panic, get online! Computers help you learn and research, which is faster than going to the library and getting a book. Say you need the date Olympic gold medalist @PERSON1 was born, Google it! Finally, once you have your information all you have to @CAPS2 is your source. Ok, now your homework is done and you want to talk to your friend about your plans on @DATE1. Computers offer numerous ways to chat online. There's @CAPS4, @CAPS5, @CAPS6, woof, @CAPS7, and many more. So you sign into @CAPS7, and talk with your best friend. Now your not bored anymore. Computers are a great way to decrease boredom, just by talking with friends online, but you better go to bad soon because you have @ORGANIZATION1's in the morning! As you can see, computers are incorporated into our daily lives. They're everywhere! I believe that they're changing society, mostly for the better. They teach hand eye coordination, help you research and learn, and let you chat with friends. Additionally, if you don't already have a computer, then get one!"
4,"@ORGANIZATION1, In my pointier, I think that computers are positive and can give a lot of information to us humans. Even though some people say computers are sometimes used way too much, computers help the world get in touch with relatives and family"
4,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1 staff, Are computers helpful to us regularly? Computers are very helpful machines that increase productivity daily. Computers not only help people discover @ORGANIZATION1 places and learn more about other parts of the world, but also computer allow people to communicate with others around the world. In addition, computers have word processor and other applications that help workers do their jobs daily. So, now do computers help people learn more about our earth? Many teachers and students use computers daily to help them teach. There are many online websites that help students discover and process different areas around the world. For example, there is a @LOCATION1 website (www.canadamaps.org) and this website has a map and students have to match the place/area onto the map. There are also website such as map quest & yellow pages to help people navigate cross country and around town. As you can see, computers also help students education and just our everyday life. A large amount of teenagers of all ages like to use a programs on computers called @CAPS1. @CAPS1 stands for @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS2 @CAPS3. This program allows people of all ages to talk with their friends or colleagues instantly. What one does, is type in a chat box to someone and the message is instantly sent to the person. Emailing is used for many things. To catch up with friends, or to talk something with another. One can also attach documents that @MONTH1 consist. Emailing helps things go faster as well as your computers. But, if your newspaper were written out by hand, then that would take a lot of time, people, paper, & money. As you can even see, @ORGANIZATION1, computers are a necessity! So, as you can see computers really are needed. Computers affect us in many ways that aren't noticed clearly or easily. Like I said, computers teach and help people learn about different places among the world today, helps us communicate with others around us or in @LOCATION2! And as well, allow us to bring our work, family, friends, and cases everywhere we, in addition to computers allowing us to word process papers so our lives are ease for our everyday life. So, don't spent your life on the computer but use it for our needs. Please use computers to help our everyday routine. Stop writing on that pad, get up and type it on your computer!"
4,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you probably have seen there is a lot of controversy over weather computers are helpful or harmful. I for one agree computers are helpful because, they help you learn about new things, talk to people around the world, and try new things. For instance have you ever wondered what the capital of @LOCATION6 is? Well with the you could find that answer in the blink of an eye, that's because the internet gives you unparalleled information that no book has. The internet Sally lets you see what is happening in or world because there are various news sources, and blogs on the internet, @PERSON1 do you remember the earthquake in @LOCATION4 well I sure do, because I found it out on the internet. You can also find directions to places, sports stats and about different places. Well whats a better way to find out a bout those than talking with people who live there? I don't think anything is, seriously is it better reading about @LOCATION5 or talking to someone in @LOCATION5? Thats the beauty of the internet is it bonds the world together into a tighter relationship, I remember chatting with people from @LOCATION3 while the gold medal game @PERSON3. Sure some people would say that you could meet someone in person from a different country, well how would you meet someone from @LOCATION2 in @LOCATION1, because I never have. People could say go to the place to talk to the person and, with the internet, it's very possible. Have you @PERSON1 wanted to go to @PERSON4? Well with the internet all you need is your credit card and you could be there tomorrow because the internet allows you to try new things. Have you ever wanted to try ping pong, it so you could or does a set offline and have it shipped to you in a couple of days, I always wanted to go to a zoo but, I didn't know of any, so I used the internet and see school for zoos near @LOCATION1, @LOCATION1 and before I could move the results for @PERSON2 zoo were right in front of me. That is why the internet is very helpful. To sum it all up the internet is very helpful to people who use it correctly, but I agree that the internet can be inappropriate. With black son the not needed sites the internet can do almost anything."
4,"Dear The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, Computers are a great piece of technology. Computers are great for many reasons. Three of these reasons are pleasure, convenience, and education. I believe that these three reasons are the main reason we use computers today. One reason we use computers is for pleasure. On certain websites, you can talk to friends, see what your friends are doing, you can even video chat with them. Also, you can watch movies, @CAPS4 episodes, and videos. In addition, you can listen to music, play games, and check sports scores. I strongly believe that pleasure is one of the main reasons we use computers today. Another reason why we use computers is convenience. Most people in @LOCATION1 have a computer in their home. Computers are convenient because you pay bills on the internet. You email coworkers about jobs. In addition, computers can help people create websites so their their business is more noticeable. As you can see, computers are a very convenient piece of technology. The final reason why we use computers is education. On a computer, you can learn just about anything. You can learn about @CAPS5 history, sports, you can learn about current events in the world. Computers can help you study, take notes, and helps do your homework. When I have a project, I always use the computer to find important information about the topic. As you can see, education is the most important reason why we use computers. Now, I think you understand how computers are important in @LOCATION1's education, pleasure and convenience. I hope you listened to my opinion on computers and I also hope you continue to tell people how great and important computers are."
4,"Dear local newspaper, I am writing to you today about how more and more people are using computers. I think that this is great. The reasons why I think so is because it teaches hand eye coordination, it gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and it also allows people to talk online with other people. Keep reading to find out more. The first reason why I think that more and more people are using computers is because it teaches people better hand eye coordination, for example, there could be a program for the computer that teaches you to type with your hands and not just your index fingers. You then can learn how to do all this without even looking at the keyboard. Keep reading for more information. The second reason why I think that more and more people are using computers is because it gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. For example, if you have a project for school and you are doing research on another country, you could use your computer to get more information about their religions or just the whole country in general. You can also use the computer to look up different kinds of people. You can look up people like @PERSON1 from @DATE1's to @PERSON2 who is our president now. Keep reading for more information. The last reason why I think that more and more people are using computers is because it allows people to talk online with other people. For example, you could set up and account on Facebook, MySpace, @CAPS1, or @CAPS2 and start talking to people. You could get to know some kids who live in you neighborhood that you never even knew. Keep reading to find out more. Lastly, I think that more and more people are using computers is great thing. They can learn hand eye coordination, have the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and have the opportunity to talk to other people online. I talked to the people who have just started to use computers and @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people said that they had liked what they had seen. So, I want you to go out there and get a computer and see what you think about it. Thank you."
4,"Imagine this: You entered a raffle at your child's school for an all expense paid trip to @LOCATION1, and you won! You are so excited until you realize you know nothing about @LOCATION1. You don't know what the weather is like, you don't know what kinds of food they eat. You're not quite sure how to prepare for the trip. So you go online and learn everything and anything about @LOCATION1. You pack appropriately, and you have a great time. All because you had a computer. Computers can help you get a better education, no matter what your age. It also gives you the ability to keep in touch with friends and family, and are necessary for many jobs. Computers help many people learn about different countries and cultures. We know so much more about other places now than we did before computers. But computers can teach you so much more than just different countries. They can teach a whole new language, or help you understand the science lesson better. There are many online colleges where you can learn the lessons online and on your own time which is good if your really busy. The internet is a great way to keep in touch with your friends and family. You can use email, instant messaging, video chatting, or you can make an account on websites like Facebook or MySpace. For example, my cousin is in the navy, he has been for @NUM1 years, and before I got a Facebook, I had lost touch. Now I talk to him all the time. When most people hear computers, the first thing that pops into their head is ""internet"". But that's not all a computer is good for. Nowadays, many jobs use computers. Banks, @CAPS1, teachers, @CAPS2, even cashiers. Computers are no longer a luxury; they have become a necessity. In fact, @NUM2 out of @NUM3 jobs require a computer. Computers allow you to type up that book report, or make a very important letter look professional. Computers have changed the world; and once it's changed there's no going back. So, it looks like access to a computer made that trip to @LOCATION1 easier. Clearly, computers have become a part of every day life. You can keep in touch with your friends and use it for your job. But most importantly, you can learn so much!"
4,"Dear Readers, I understand that some @MONTH1 think computers can effect peoples' lives. This is because it causes them to not go outside exercising and enjoying nature. My point of view is that people have the choice to go out side, exercise, and enjoy nature. Computers give so much information that it could give people ideas of different activities people can do outdoors. Computers also have abilities to download videos and other soft ware that people can look at and perform excising with them, and learn techniques. In my life my mom and dad, and many other people I'm my family, look online at different websites to see what activities we can do on the weekends and seasonal activities. Computers are very I'mportant and are life changing. If it wasn't for computers some people wouldn't be able to get an education. Doctors, police officers, and banks use computers for their job and it helps us go through are everyday lives with ease. From what i see and understand i that computers have a positive effect on our lives. Computers can be negative but it all has to do with self control and how you use it."
4,"Computers are becoming more advanced everyday, almost everyone owned, or owns a computer. I think, thee benefit society very greatly. One of the many ways is, they teach you hand eye coordination. So even @CAPS1 your playing games your hand eye coordination @MONTH1 be improving. With hand eye coordination you @MONTH1 need it to play sports like baseball. When do you need hand eye coordination the most? I use it most, when I'm playing hockey or, baseball. So next time your on a computer, remember your hand eye coordination is improving. Anothee reason we benefit from having computers, is we learn about far away places. @CAPS1, you know about places that are far away from you that you can or can't travel to, use a computer to gain some background knowledge @CAPS1 you travel somewhere on business and know nothing about it, what do you do? I know! get on a computer and do some research about it! An example of this is, @CAPS1 you have to fly out to @LOCATION1 and don't know any thin about it, use a laptop on the way over theee. @CAPS1 you do that, you'll have some schema about the place. As you can see laptops and computers are great for learning of foreign countries. Finally, computers are great for learning a new language. You need to learn Spanish in a couple of weeks. What will you do? Download a free language learning app. @CAPS1 you don't know a lot of french and need a few words but don't have a dictionary. Use a translator. When you are talking to someone from @LOCATION1 and you don't know theee language use an English to African dictionary translation app on your computer. Computers have a great trans later applications that are free so, @CAPS1 you don't know a language hop on a computer and learn it! In conclusion, computers are used every day and help us greatly, weathee it be learning a new language, or just talking to friends. Computer benefit society greatly."
4,"Dear newspaper I think that there are many reason why computers are good for people. Compters are good for people because they help keep friends connected. Reason two is that they can be great knowledge   for people. @CAPS1 third reason that computers are good for people is that there are many programs that are team based and help people with team works and team building skills. Those are three of the many reasons why I think that computers are good for people and have had a positive effect. First of all, I think that computers are good for people because they help keep friends connected. If you move to another town, go to a col ledge far away, or move because of a job you will most likely, if @CAPS5 is further away, loose connection with you friends. But, using a computer can solve that problem. In social networking sites like @CAPS3, twitter and MySpace you can simply look up your distant friends from  you previously lived and have contact with them. Youi can catch up with each other, recall good times you've had, end maybe make plans to meet each other sometime. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 have been reconnected using social networking site on a computer. Experts also say that @CAPS5 is important to stay connected with your past to sustain a well being and to be happier. I have had an experience when a social networking site has reconnected me with a @CAPS2. When i was younger I had a @CAPS2 WHO's grandmother lived  to @CAPS1 dad. After a little over a year of  him being good friends be moves to @LOCATION1, I thought I would never hear from him again. Later that year I also moved to a different town, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 searched me on @CAPS3 and we got connected again, I have found out he moved back to where I use to live. That is the first reason I think that computers are @CAPS4 good for people. The second reason, @CAPS5 is that computers can be great knowledgee sources for people. If you ever need to set information   that not have to  through the  of book,then, a computer is the thing for you. As long as you than  to find an accurate and reliable scours than a computer. Is an amazing tool. You can look up almost anything and you will be able to find locks of information on @CAPS5. Statistics show that you can find @PERCENT2 more information on a computer than a book. Experts have stated that soon books will be obsolete and computer will rain  as knowledgee sources. That is the second reason why I think computers are good for people. Last of all, I think that computers are good for people because there are many programs that help with teamwork and team buildings skills. What I  by programs is yes of course video games. Almost all of the computer games out have multiplier features. Withins the multiplier universe there are match types that involve a great amount of teamwork. In the age games you must communicate and talk to your team if you want to win. And that is the only way you will win is by using teamwork. That is @CAPS1 third reason why I think computers are good for people. In conclusion, I think that computers are good for people, they help to reconnect friends, , knowledgee, and build team building skills with programs that are out for @CAPS5."
4,"Dear local newspaper, I believe computers have a good effect on people. The reasons believe that is because the computer teaches us a lot of things, you can also find a relative you have not seen in a long time. Two more reasons is because you could talk to your friends, another is you need it to put music on @NUM1's, @CAPS1's and other devices. My first reason I thought computers have a good effect on people was because it teaches us alto of things. If you wanted to know about a countries culture you will be able to go and find out on the computer. Without the computer you would have to visit not knowing what shot to take for sickness they have. Other things it could teach you is how to get from one place to another without stopping to ask people where a place is. It's important to know things on on the computer you can look it up and find out. Another is you can find a family member you haven't seen in along time. Being able to reconnect with someone is very important. What if something happened to them and you didn't know, like a broke leg or hip you can find out if you find them on the computer. Also alto of people @MONTH1 have family they miss and want to be close to or talk to again they cannot find them and fill close to them again. And they can find you if they Reilly need to talk to you. You could also talk to your friends in a chat room with other friends or alone. If you have moved far away the computer is a good way to keep in touch with your old friends. Talking to a friends re leaves some kids of their stress they had. It helps when your friends make you laugh and talk to you about leaving everything alone and breath. Everyone has one friend that talks them out of doing bad things. A friend like that is helpful. Last reason is you need a computer to put music on your @NUM1 players. Music is very fun and alto of people love to listen to it. If you had no computers there would be no point in buying a lot of electronic devices because a lot you need the computer for. People like to listen to music on their @CAPS1 or @NUM1 while exercising but you need the computer to put music on it. Without computers their's no point of music. In conclusion I think computers have a good effect on people."
4,"To @CAPS1 it @MONTH1 concern, today people of all ages are using computers. Computers are a great way to do reports, talk to friends & family, & also to research things you @MONTH1 have needed to know. Kids in @ORGANIZATION1 have many projects to do & most of these projects involve writing a paper. Teacher have trouble reading other hand writing so it would be helpful for the students to use the computer to print out a very neat paper. The computer has many ways that you can write that paper & now it will be very helpful. The near by library will always have extra computers students can use to write a pap per. If you walk by a teenager on the internet, now a days you @MONTH1 find them on '@CAPS2'. '@CAPS2' is a website to talk to friends & relatives. Some of these relatives @MONTH1 live very far away or not have a phone to talk on, so you can talk to them here. Some people think '@CAPS2' is 'stupid' & can't be any good, because it takes away time for homework, but what if a @CAPS3 forgot to write down the homework? The @CAPS3 could go on '@CAPS2' & chat with a friend from @ORGANIZATION1 to get that home work. There are many search engines on the computer such as '@CAPS4 pile', '@CAPS5', or even the ever most popular '@ORGANIZATION2'. Most people use these web pages to research for papers, trips, or even just to find out random information. Many people want to go to @LOCATION2 or @LOCATION1 for @CAPS6, but don't know what to do when they get there. By going on one of the search engines they would find that in @LOCATION1 they could go to the @LOCATION1 zoo. In @LOCATION2 they could go to @CAPS7 world or the @CAPS8 @CAPS9 @CAPS10 to learn all about @CAPS11 & how it is in a @CAPS9. Thank you for taking the time to read this & I hope you will look into what I said."
4,"Dear Local @CAPS1 Newspaper, @CAPS2 I see why some people think that computers and technology are bad for society, I on the other hand strongly disagree with them. In my eyes technology, especially computers can bring people together and computers are very beneficial to @CAPS5. Also computers can save you time and money now. First off computers can bring people together. I had one of my best friends move across the country, all the way to @LOCATION1! and I don't get to see her so I now video chat with her on my laptop. and if I didn't have that opportunity then we probably wouldn't have stayed in touch with each other. That experience was not only with a friend but it happened with a family member as well, my grandmother. Every year for Passover the whole family comes to house to celebrate but because she is getting older we video chat so she can see the whole family together. It is wonderful experience. As I said before computers can be beneficial to @CAPS5. You might be thinking ""@CAPS3 it can only understand that but I am a student at @ORGANIZATION1 and sometimes I forget to write an assignment down so I get my laptop and go to @ORGANIZATION1 notes. com, if that was have gotten a zero on the homework. See! Computers are very beneficial! Have you ever been in a situation where you need something but you just don't have time? Well now many things can be ordered offline. You can get things from food to cloths and toys. Surveys have proven that over @PERCENT1 of average @CAPS4 order off of the computer and save money from gas because they don't have to drive. Overall, I think computers can be handy and helpful to all ages, @CAPS5 with home works, family and friends and adults who don't have a lot of time. And I think as years go by more and more people will start to realize that."
4,"Dear @CAPS1, I am aware of the current debate about technology, however more specifically computers. Computers are a helpful interesting & even fun peace of technology. Computers open the world to new people & places & limiting that is uncalled for. Computers are keys to innovation & creation. When @ORGANIZATION1 did a study on the use of computers @PERCENT1 of people said they got their news files & even planned threw the computer & now @PERCENT2 of creations are being done through the computer. This illustrates the power of computers allowing people to do things that were once impossible. Now humans are capable of spreading info around the world in seconds. Computers also business grow through advertisement or work soft wares. Computers are the key to help open the world to new poss abilities & options not possible @NUM1 years ago. I understand my opposition is not only against computers but wants to limit there use. That is unfair & possibly unconstitutional. They argue that people exercise less due to computers, however @PERCENT3 of people, when asked has computers negatively impacted your exercise said ""no"" & one man stated ""because of computers I learned new workouts & even found a great local trainer."" @CAPS2 you can understand computers are not just about games & toys, but allowing people to grow & learn more to help them find plazas to travel & assist in their exercise. Computers are a wonderful tool when it comes to communication. Emails, @CAPS3 and other soft wares allow people to communicate ac cross the world. @CAPS2 the world begins to in ovate itself communication is key. People are capable of spreading news in seconds, in fact @PERCENT4 of news is now done through the computer. New @CAPS4 times & the wall street @CAPS5 have moved their news mainly to the internet allowing people across the to see them. Work is also primarily done through the computer now. People are able to send files, ship & even order online. Even important business meeting are done thought the computer, where all the people can be at their house. Computers are necessity when it comes to communications work & news. I hope you understand & put to use my opinion. Computers are needed to grow @CAPS2 a world solving problems communicating & expanding that is why I be live there is no problems with computers."
4,"Dear @PERSON1 @CAPS1 I am writing this letter to inform you that I think computers are a smart investment for a couple of reasons. The following are some reasons on why computers benefit society, they allow children to do homework with some help, children can talk to other friend and when children are board they can play games music on it. UGH! I don't get this sometimes I am sitting at the kitchen table Turing to do my history homework but I don't know the year the revolutionary war was. @CAPS2 I go in my room turn the computer on and @CAPS6 there I go to Google and look up what I need to know. This also benefits parents too because if they are doing the bills or something they don't have to be bot here, the kid could look it up and know it is @CAPS6! Finally all my homework is done but my computer is still on I'm going to see who is online that I can talk to and make sure I didn't miss any homework. Talking to your friends online could help you stay in contact with friends in other states or just people you don't see very often. This can help make new friends or make friendships closer and cause less problems. Alright no body is home or online @CAPS2 I think @CAPS3 going to kick back turn some music to kick back turn some music on and maybe take a nap. Or I can play the new counter strike game I got ! YEAH on playing counter strike. Least death on my team that game! Alright that's enough of counter strike for the day I think I'm going to turn same music on and lay in bed. Now that I have told you all of the benefits of computers You @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6! keep in mind that it can help with homework, talking with friends, or just having some fun."
4,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Computers are helpful once in a while but @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people believe that they are a waste of electricity. Computers aren't beneficial to everyday life overall. When people are on the computer they spend multiple hours on it. This means that they aren't getting enough exercise and that they are harming them bodies. Not only this but people have a tendency to use this machine obsessively. They spend more attention on the computer and not enough time with your family. Every one knows exercise is important. However, what happens when we don't get enough? Heart disease is the number one cause of death in the @LOCATION1. Heart disease is caused by obesity. That's what happens when you don't exercise. When you are on the computer you are sitting down rather than moving around. This means that your metabolism isn't going and you burn less calories. That is not healthy for anyone. Even people in perfect condition. Gaining weight isn't the only way you can potentially harm your body. When using the computer you have to look at the screen which is with very bright @CAPS3 lights. After looking at the screen for so long your eyes will begin to feel the affects of the lights. Many people say its like staring into a flashlight for an extended amount of time. About @PERCENT1 of the kids at our school wear glasses because of using the computer for to long. That @PERCENT1 is @PERCENT2 more than we had before. We used to have about @NUM3. Like I said before, when you use the computer you use it for an extended amount of time. What about family? They deserve more attention than a machine. To spend more time on the computer than your own flesh and blood isn't right. In a survey an average of @NUM4 out of @NUM5 people said that the spent about eight hours on the computer between work and home, and about an hour with family. The results were more than shocking with all of this in mind, ask your self how useful the computer really is. Sure it's good at researching things quickly but its also good at making people gain weight, making people spend money on glasses and tearing them away from their family members. At the end of the day, the computer isn't very helpful at all."
4,"Dear, newspaper writer I think the computer has a positive effect of people because @CAPS1 helps people around the world learn to speak a different language, @CAPS1 helps people talk to their friends around the world and @CAPS1 helps people by making @CAPS1 easier to write a letter and send @CAPS1 out to people they work for or to their bosses that need the report in by the end of the day. Those are the three reason that computers have a positive effect. @CAPS1 helps people learn to speak a different language without spending a lot of money like using Rosetta stone you have to spend @NUM1 us dollars but online you dint have to spend a dime. the best part is that @CAPS1 is free. The slogan for Rosetta stone is ""I have spent less money than months of formal classes."" I think their new slogan should be is "" we have a better learning company than anyone else."" That is why @CAPS1 helps people learn a different language. @CAPS1 also helps people by making @CAPS1 easier to talk to their friends you can aim, web cast, and ever text to make @CAPS1 easier @CAPS1 talk to friends on the internet. The reason they created that is so people dint have to travel to far away places and spend money to tell a friend important news that is only one thing. So in conclusion you dint have to spend a lot of money to tell a friend something. The third reason that the computer helps people is that people San e mail the or boss that they are faxing their final re poet to the big interview for a new position in the place where they work, @CAPS1 helps your boss by making @CAPS1 easier to read and @CAPS1 better because you could be in japan and your boss could be in Florida @CAPS1 will take like @NUM2 minutes to get to your bosses computer. That is why @CAPS1 is easier to send messages to your boss. The three main reasons are that you can learn a different language without paying a dime that you can talk to your friends easier and that you can send messages to your boss easier that calling him or her. Those are the three reasons that computers are positive."
4,"Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers are beneficial to society. This because computers do tasks such as helps research, communicating with others, and has fun games and websites. Computers are really great sources for whatever you trying to do. Honestly, a @CAPS2 without computers I wouldn't know what to do. Computers are like digital encyclopedias, which has just about all the information your looking for. Computers have databases or websites design to have with research just as the do. Say that you have a essay due tom morrow and you need quick and valid information you can simple go to @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 which is a computer database. Your end up with sailed facts to help with your final draft. So, you wouldn't have to go that far to research. Communicating is something else the computer helps with. For example email and @ORGANIZATION1 is a way to communicate. Email is where you can send a message and a wait a reply while on the other hand @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 is where you get @ORGANIZATION1 replays. The latest thing in the communicating @CAPS2 is video charting. This where the person your chatting with can hear and see exactly what your doing. This is useful for families who life a good distance from each other. Computers play many roles and being used for fun is one. the @CAPS5 has many fun gaming websites such as @CAPS6.com miniclips.com, and @LOCATION1. This websites help take your mind off a bad day. You can also buy computer games for your computer. A very popular game is The @CAPS7. This game is base around your character and the life you chose for it to live this game can take you to mother place where all your stress just fade away. So, computers betters society in many different ways. A few include research, communication, and to have fun. The computer is a very enhanced tool to enrich ones life. Computers take on difficult tasks and usually sicced. So, computers are truly one thing we need."
4,"Dear people, Computers have been here for not a very long time and everyday more people buy computers and everyday people use them. As they are used for entertainment, education, and talking with people faraway, they have had a negative effect on people. Let me explain. First of all, as people use computers in the beginning they enjoy it. They go on the @CAPS1, play games, and use it for work. But as they keep using it, they start to get addicted. People are addicted to computers because of the games and being able to go on the @CAPS1. In fact, @PERCENT1 of all the people in this @CAPS3 who owns a @CAPS8, is addicted to computers. That percentage is expected to grow to @PERCENT2 in the next @NUM1 years. Addiction to computers lead to serious issues. People have died because they spent too much time on the @CAPS8 without eating and sleeping. In another newspaper not long ago, it stated that a student attending @ORGANIZATION1, was dropped out for doing so poorly during school. His parent found out that he was addicted to this game ""@CAPS3 of @CAPS4."" This game is right now the most played game on the @CAPS8 in this @CAPS3. Studies state that @CAPS8 addiction is almost as bad as smoking addiction. My second reason why @CAPS8 has a negative effect on people is because of online bullying. People chat on @CAPS5, @CAPS6, @CAPS7, and email and people are bullied. A friend of mine recently was emailed with words that hurt his feeling. Online bullying is worse that interacting bullying. That's because @CAPS9 you say something on the @CAPS8, people don't know who you are. @PERSON1, a professor who recently did studies of online bullying says, ""Online bullying has become more severe than contact to contact bullying. People are threatened more and hear more bad words than interacting."" The online bullying and harassment is going to get worse @CAPS9 people don't stop. Also people can get arrested for what they write online. My final reason why computers have a negative effect on people is that people spend too much time on computers and don't exercise @CAPS8 contribute about @PERCENT3 to overweight people. On the @CAPS8, everything is much easier. Instead of mailing, you could email. You can listen to music instead of walking up to the radio and turning it on. You could buy tickets, shop, talk with friends, and have fun just by sitting on a @CAPS8. But this is why people become overweight and obese. @PERCENT4 of the people who use computers are obese or overweight. Peole spend less time interacting with friends and family and enjoying nature. In conclusion, computers have a negative effect on people and parents should control their child's time on the computers. Just because of a @CAPS8, many issues rise. So @CAPS9 you think you are addicted, try to make a time schedule for your whole day. Use the @CAPS8 for an hour a time and take rests before using it again. Addiction, online bullying, and becoming overweight is not the only problems of a @CAPS8, there are many more."
4,"Dear newspaper I hear the more and more people use computers and I think that's so awesome because people talk online with other people. @CAPS5 they teach you how to use a computer. It gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. Computers it the more advanced technology so its @CAPS1 the people is using it. I love to be in the computer all day because I always enter to @CAPS2 and talk online. @CAPS4 example some people like to talk with a family member the is not in the @LOCATION1 so they communicate from the computer. Sometimes I talk online with my cousin in @LOCATION2 because I have @NUM1 years I dint see her. So I think talk online or using the computer is important. @CAPS4 example even grandma have @CAPS3 and she talks online with her family members. I think the using the computer is not a bad benefit because it helps you be in communication with your family or friends. That is why I think the people is wrong saying the or is not. Secondly, it teach you hand eye coordination my grandma is old but computer and @CAPS4 example my grandma a nice hand eye coordination because when she goes to the letters she just res and all she is correct. think computers have a effect on people. It @CAPS5 helps people write better and better. @CAPS4 example I love and when it write I dint need to go to other I write king of @CAPS5 the helps me with my eye and hand @CAPS6 is the it helps you find faraway places and people. @CAPS4 example on @ORGANIZATION1 you find what ever street you want. It @CAPS5 help you find in the computer about people. @CAPS4 example if I have a project I find the information on @ORGANIZATION1 about people or places. The computer is really helpful because you could find pictures of places and information of people. I think is a positive effect on people. Finally, I think the computers are great benefits society. One reason is the you could talk online with people. @CAPS5 it teach you hand eye and the helps your brain and sight. It @CAPS5 helps you at your hand movements. @CAPS6 reason is the give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. @CAPS4 example I have a project in @CAPS7 and I have to learn and search about forensic doctor and I search everything on the computer. I think the computers help your brain think more and computers are advanced technology. So I think their benefits our society."
4,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 a student I believe that computers have many bad effects on people. Most people think that computers are just new helpful technology, but there is more to it than just that. There are many things going on in the cuber world. Computers are quite helpful in school research, work and other important stuff, but there are many bad effects too. Kids these days are so attached to their computers almost all day after getting home from school which means that they barely do homework, projects, and important assignments from getting too distracted by the computer. There are some paren'ts who get tricked by their kids that they are just doing homework, but reality is that kids these times are meeting tons of strangers through social networks such @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS4, @CAPS5 @NUM1, @CAPS6 and other networks. Once that they decide to meet in person with these strangers many things go wrong because not everyone is @CAPS2 nice @CAPS2 they @MONTH1 seem through the internet. It shows how dangerous it can be for kids to be using the computers so much. people such @CAPS2 young children, pare teens and teenagers are able to view many harmful and inappropriate things anyone their ages shouldn't be viewing at all. Another concern is how people spend all day on their computers probably eating any type of junk food and then they don't exercise at all and they gain weight and not well fit physically which becomes a health issue for kids @CAPS2 age @NUM2 to much older people such @CAPS2 age @NUM3 and much older too which turns out to be a bad health life for people. From people spending nearly all day on the computer, they aren't able to go out and discover new things, exercise, hang out with friends or just have fun and spend time with their families. I also do strongly consider that the computers or laptops should not stay in a kids room because then they lock themselves in their room all day and they even stay up till really late even past midnight and then it becomes a real issue for kids or adults to get up early in the @TIME1 for school or work and are usually late. This paretty much shows how computers are not so great for people all the time. In order for people to be able to use their computers and have a life they can plan out a schedule of how long to use the computer and it might help them out a lot."
4,"I believe that people spending to much time on computers can effect their health and the relationship they have with friends and family. If you are on the computer and one of your friends ask you to go outside you are most likely to say no because the computer is grabbing your attention more than going outside. That hurts your health and your relationship with your friend. If your family is going to a movie to have family time maybe you will stay because you would stay home on the computer. That effects the relationship with your family. Most people rather stay on the computer than spend time working out. So that effects your health because most of the time your on the computer for a long time your going to end up hungry and keep eating and eating and since your not working out you get fat. Now your not working out and you just keep eating. So since you are not working out and your mind is always on the computer you can get sick. Thats why most people are not healthy because of computers. Computers can mess up your relationships with family and friends. Sometimes your friend can ask you to go outside or to work out and you say no because your on the computer that messes up your relationship with your friend. Or your family can be having a movie night and your on the computer while they leave. That is messing up the relationship with your family. Being on the computer you can go nights without sleeping. I your playing a relay good game on the computer and it comes time for you to take a rest and since the game is so fun you don't sleep. Then after a while you get addicted and won't stop playing. So you won't get sleep and if you have school you won't be able to concentrate you will to busy worried about the game. So that's why computer aren't so good. It can mess up your health. I can mess up your social life with family and friends. You won't get a lot of sleep and won't be able to concentrate."
4,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1! Get off that computer it is @TIME1. But mom I dint want to I'm in the middle of a game. Does that conversation sound familiar? Of course it does. Every kid likes to play on the computer. However, noticing your kid being on the computer @NUM1 is not a good thing. In this matter experts are defiantly @PERCENT1 right because kids and adults are spending too much tI'me on the computer. These people can do other things like exercising more, enjoying nature, and interacting with friends and family. Spending too much tI'me on the computer is not healthy. On the other hand, if someone kicks you of the computer you can always get that six pack you wanted. There are three main things that can get you in shape. First, taking a light run every night on your community track can get your legs from being fatigued every tI'me you walk up the stairs to having your legs be firm and able to run lap after lap just for a warm up. Every years my dad takes me to the track in @DATE1 and tI'mes me for @NUM2 and @NUM3 yard dash, the @NUM4 meter, and the mile. Between the months I train all the way up to @DATE2 then my dad does another assent. I do this training because I play baseball. Weight lifting is another way to get in shape. Some basic excesses are bench pressing, squatting, and dumb ell curl es. There are more challenging excesses but I won't go into that. Once you feel like your in shape, take all of that training and put it into a sport. Excersising is not the only thing you can do. Enjoying nature is another option. Just go outside if someone kicks you off your computer. Absoarb everything about the nature. From the squirrels to the tress. If you are in the winter enjoy the snow unstudied of being inside @NUM1 playing computer games. But, if that doesn't work out for you then hangout with your family. Hanging out with your family can be thing you can do. Gather your family and plan a trip. You can go to a baseball game, park, or movies anything that will get you away from that computer. That is my opinion why I think people should get excesses, enjoy nature, and spend tI'me with their families ins ted of being on the computer @NUM1."
4,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I think Computers have a bad effect on people for three reasons. One they can really hurt your eyes, two it is not safe if you have little kids in your house. Finaully three you will never see your family or friends if your on the computer. The first reason was computers have a bad effect on people is it can really hurt your eyes. If your always starring at a computer screen all the time you can go blind. And with you having bad eyes you can get serious head injures just from hurting your eyes. The second reason why computers have a bad affects on people it is not safe if you have little kids in your home. Like you can be watching adult movie that little kids are'nt aged enough to see if can have a bad effect And it has a bad effect on people because you will have no and if you have a little kid in your house he will always be in and he will probably hear something really, really kid like music, @CAPS3 if you have a kid house The reason was computers have bad effects on people is that if your always on a computer you will never see your family and @CAPS3 if you are always on the computers you will miss out on the And will never you never see and don't @CAPS3 a rent on on the computers. @CAPS3 what you look And keep the little kid with you in the house. And last get off the computer and go see your family and friends. "
4,"Dear @CAPS1, People like computers, @CAPS2 a known fact. They are very much like a dry, addicting and irrefutable. Despite what people believe though computers are very good for our daily lives. You can communicate play @ORGANIZATION1, listen to music watch movies, even learn a language on the computers. So in all ways, the computer is anything but bad. @ORGANIZATION1 are fun. They help us relax. In to days age, @ORGANIZATION1 just don't give people the joy they experienced when younger. Computer @ORGANIZATION1, they are the replacement. Imagine playing baseball with a friend who lives miles away from you, while still being a kid in @LOCATION1, or set in your exercise adventure. Computer @ORGANIZATION1 broke the border giving you a higher level or ""You got mail"". Many people hear that sentence more than once everyday. By many, I mean millions. @CAPS2 a alert saying that someone sent you a email. @CAPS4 are messages. Sent over the @CAPS7, faster than any service. Instead of waiting @NUM1 days for a letter, In a matter of minutes you can have a message sent to your friends. Microsoft @CAPS3 @CAPS4, and other electronic messaging systems are a superior form of communication, these let us speak to the world! Although it sounds silly, @CAPS5 you wanted by you could send a message to anyone with a message box. Lets say you went to watch a certain movie, but you don't own it. With a computer with a dose drive, you can watch any @CAPS6. Better yet, you can download the movies media are available @CAPS7, with you able to watch them with the click of the mouse. Computers are filled to the top with gadgets & accessories that make our life easier. @ORGANIZATION1, movies, @CAPS4 anything you is not likely on a computer. They are the perfect tolls in modern society."
4,"Dear @CAPS1: Some people believe computers benefit society. However, others feel they are too consuming. I for me I be live computers help society. Computers teach hand eye coordination, give people, and even allows computer to chat online with other people. I'd bet your job requires you to use a computer, you probably even have a personal computer which you like to use to chat with friends. I do that all the time and I like it. Another thing I like are sports. One of my favorite sports is softball. In softball you need to have hand eye coordination, this will help you swing at the ball more accurately. When a pitcher throws the ball you have to had the bat at the right angle and watch the ball to know when to swing if kids used computers and become good at hand eye coordination, then possibly more kids would join a local sports team, and possibly even join travel team. Do you like to travel? I do, and are why I learn about places before I go is by looking that particular place up on the internet. About three years ago I went on vacation to @LOCATION1. I wanted to know what it was like there because I had never gone before, so when I looked it up I found out that they had many tourist attractions and ""packages"" that let you swim with dolphins, I was very excited to go and when I did, I had a boast, and to think if I didn't look it up I would not have known what kinds of fun things they had! No wonder so many people like computers! One of the biggest reasons why I like computers is because I can chat with my friends online one main attraction online is @CAPS2, everybody, primarily, has one. Some people have one because they like to look at pictures. I have one because I like to chat with my friends. One night I was chatting with a friend we were laughing having a great time, and then she reminded me that we had science homework due the very next day! I thanked her and then completed my work. You see if kids chat online their friends can remind them of important necessity's such of homework. This could improve grades by @PERCENT1! So you now see why society needs computers and if you have forgotten let me remind you: computers teach you hand eye coordination, let's you learn about faraway places and people, and now allows you to chat online. Just think what would society be like with no computers."
4,"If you ask me, computers are going to soon be a big problem in our life'styles. Computers are just another material thing everyone has and seems to be benefiting from, but they aren'@CAPS1. This technology is taking away peoples freedom and will and they don'@CAPS1 even notice it. It is pretty clear to me things need to change. To begin, the computer is yet another distraction to our daily lives. I think that it is safe to admit that we don'@CAPS1 need this. Distractions like these keep us from doing the things we need to do, such as excesses. Every wants to get their extra weight off, but they can'@CAPS1 because the want to check website or talk to their friends. So its pretty much a lazy distraction. Would you really want to give up your health because of something so materialistic? If we keep clicking, more then @PERCENT1 of the population that are fit and healthy will become ob ease. I think we need to reform this problem soon. Like not promoting websites on so many @CAPS1.V networks, or have a computer shutdown week, anything that will get people to be outside enjoying life as they should. To continue, have you ever found yourself asking your kids on how to work the computer? Dont you see how sad that is? Our future leaders are already glued to the games, email and instant messaging of the net. Its plain to see they are already spending too much of their time online. This is concerning fact because more and more kids each year turn in less and less in school work because they  have better things to do such as chat with their friends or watch funny video online. Its a scary though because these children are our future leaders. This is a critical point in their life's. They need to learn about things now so their futures aren't hanging by a thread. Instead of making a habit of going online everyday why not make a habit like try to get all your homework done each night? Things in children life's need to change before they pay for it later in life. To sum it up, many things about our life'styles need to change. Wether it be in school work or losing weight. So I think it would be best if we took out, or less end our computer usage to lower the distraction and more on in life without revolving our world arid a click."
4,"Proven by @PERSON2 the best @CAPS1 major over @PERCENT1 of children either have desktops, laptops, or some type of internet access. What so you think about this? Well I the computers are taking up people time (like children) and not letting them get their work done. Also, computer are not only letting people talk to their friend, but its causing @CAPS5 bullying. Finally, @CAPS1 are also just ma ken parents more stressed out because the have to pay another bill for internet. Children now and days come home change and log right into the computer and start talking to friends and loosening to music all this sounds good in tell their report cards come back and they see they are failing half there classes. I remember when my friend @CAPS3 would go home change eat and log right inside the computer. As days went around the end or the year was she noticed she had two problems. She was getting over weight and she was failing all her classes. She noticed that getting on the computer was not necessary so for the next mouth and a half she cut down on her time on the @CAPS1 did her homework and started this pushed me to be leave that children have @CAPS1. Proven by @PERSON3 the saber bully that over @PERCENT2 of children have bin saber bully ed or @CAPS5 bull lied someone. All this happen when children are not being watched or get bored and to pick on someone. What should we do people ask @PERSON1 and she says well take away the @CAPS1. I remember when I read about the year old girl on new channels.com and it was about @CAPS5 bullied but never. This shows that children all over the world can be getting saber bullied of any moment."
4,"Dear local newspaper, Computers are a waste of time! People that say they are helpful are just using that as excuse. Some people say they are good for research and talking to people. Both of these things you can do without a computer. Computers are just a money wasting thing that get in your way of life. People spend hours on computers talking to people. You don't need to do that. You can use a phone instead and call them. After a study they proved that talking on a phone is cheaper then using the computer. In this economy why wouldn't you want to save money while getting the same thing also on a computer you don't really talk to the person you are really just typing word to them. This can be very dangerous. Who know if the person talking to you is really the person you think. Why take the risk when you can just use a phone! Using the computer is like smoking. It is very addicting! People stay on computers for hours every day and don't get exercise. If you just sit there moving your hand you are not really burning calories. This is a huge problem! Obecety is already rising with the number of fast food places and computers are making it worse. And the worst part is parents don't care some children go on the computer for @NUM1 hours a day and there parents don't encourage them to go outside. Children need encouragement to get moving or they will never start, and they will get bigger. We need to form a group to help stop this or before you no it @PERCENT1 of the @LOCATION1 will be obese. Another excuse that computer lovers do is they say they are doing research on a country. Even though this @MONTH1 be true there are other way you can do this. Why not ride your bike to the library and get a book on the country. By doing this you will burn calories and get to learn the same stuff you would have on the computer. Also not everything on the internet is true so you might have false information. By getting a book you know it's true. People that love computers will never get away from them over night it @MONTH1 take a month or two but if we act new we can make a change and put a stop to it. Computers are a waste of money. You can live without then very easily, and without them the world would be a better place. People are being lazy and use excuses on why they need a computer. If you are stuck on a computer for @NUM1 hours a day you will never have any family memories. All you will remember is when you were on the computer, and who wants that."
4,"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1 @CAPS2 you think that children spend to much time on the computer. The issue that is going around is @CAPS2 computers have good effects on people or bad ones. I strongly believe that they have bad effects on people. I believe this because people spend more time on the computer than they @CAPS2 exercising. Another reason is that people argue it teaches hand eye coordination, well so does sports and just playing. My last reason is that people argue that it is some thing that helps you learn about people and far away places, but books @CAPS2 the same thing. I know alto of people feel that computer have good effects but the truth is they have bad ones. First, people spend more to on the computer than they @CAPS2 exercising. People rather stay inside and play games on the internet then go outside and play tag or any sport. On a talk it was said that, ""In @LOCATION1 people are alto over weight"", and it was also said that the number of over weight people in the world was the of @LOCATION2"". So I believe that people should get of the computer and exercise. Secondly, people think that it teaches hand eye coordination but so @CAPS2 sports. Instead of being on the computer learning hand eye. You could be out side learning hand eye coordination. Again instead of just sitting at the computer your outside running around having fun while you learn hand eye coordination. My last reason is, that people argue that people use it to learn about far away places and people, but they have books for that too. People rather look stuff up on the computer but as soon as they're fin sh the start playing games or the computer. Also some of the information might not even be true. Because people hack sights all the time and change things but you can't hack a book. The only thing you can @CAPS2 to change it is to rip out pages and that only waste your money to a new book. So I believe that books are more reliable. Now is the time to make your disunion. @CAPS2 computers have good or bad effects. I believe that computers have bad effect on people. Other things could teach you remarkable hand eye coordination and other great sources to about other place then the computer. Most importantly people should spend more time exercising the they @CAPS2 on the computer. Now it time for you to go ahead and put this on the front page of your newspaper and let the whole world know. "
4,"Dear @LOCATION1, I'm writing this letter to you to tell you my opinion on the effects computers have on people. My opinion is that computers have a positive effect on people. First reason is they give the ability to learn about people and places in the world. Another reason is that computers bring unity to the nation and even the world. Last reason is it can help you be organize and get a job. Now I will move on to give more details on my first reason. When I have a school project on a famous person or somewhere in the world I know that the computer will give me more information than a book. If I am doing the project on a place and I want to know how far is it from where I live to there or whats the weather of that place all I have to do is type it down in a search engine and the computer will give me a bunch of websites that will answer my question. Now, if you can't draw a picture for your biography project go on a search engine and type down the name of the person you're doing and don't for get to type down pictures or photos and you will see a bunch of pictures of that person. Now I will move on to my second reason. Computers bring unity in the nation and the world for example think about these social networks like @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3 these networks has millions of people on them that you can talk to. And what about the @ORGANIZATION1, web cam, where you can talk to the person face to face. Just recently there been earthquakes in @LOCATION2 and @LOCATION3 you can spread the news to family members or friends to tell them to support and help those in need. Now I will move on the my last reason. Computers are everywhere there's never a job that does not have a computer. That means that you need to know how to work with computers to get a job which can be."
4,"Computers do not have a negative effect on people. They keep you in touch with family, help you do work for school, also allow you to play video games and look up music. Computers can keep you in with family and friends. Find locations to where the live. How their doing and what have they been up to. It allows you to email and lets you see friends that moved far away. Computers also help you to work for school. They help you find answer es to questions a teacher could ask. They help you write reports or reports in general for any subject. Also, there many site that you could go to; to help you with a book.The sites could also bring you to your schools website. That way, if you forgot your home work was you have a place to check. Even if you were absent most papers I questions are on the internet so you could make end to the homework. Another common thing computers are used ten is to wealth movies. Rather a old movie or a new release. Computers also do the same thing for music. Anything from @CAPS1 to @CAPS2 to country and back can be. or new @CAPS3 shows and music all be find. Video games are also popular. Many people play these because; people can friends. Talk to friends that they ha vent seen in a long time. They to not be bored. If it's raining out and nothing to to the here games. And if you one to talk to theirs always someone there to Lister to you and maybe become your friend. So computers are not a waste. They can keep you in touch, you new friends get rid of find an searches everything in @CAPS4 shows, music and movies."
4,"Dear, Local Newspaper I think that it would be better if people get outside to get so exercise and enjoy nature to interact with there family and friends. If you get out with your family and friends maybe more teens and adults would be in better shape and more healthily. Say we jump out of bed, gets some breakfast and head to the park to gets an excrete with your family and friends. Alot of family and friends i think spend way to much time on the computers or there lab tops because if they are on the computer to long then they will not want to go outside and get excuse with there friends. More and more people use the computer. But not everybody agrees on this statement. What I think it would be better to solve the problem and have everybody get outside and get some fresh air with family and friends. But some people don't think that is the right thing to go. People that think those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Well I don't think that is the way to go because you need to get outside to get some. Freshair with people. But if you want to go on the computer you can but I think it should be only for a little bit then because some people have a bossiness that they have to work on when they are at work. Sometimes people have to work on there computer every day so if that is the case they I think they should be aloud ed to use the lab top or computer. But if you are a teen you should only go on if you have to f you needing the internment or writing a paper. But if you going to go on to just go on to just talk to friend then that is a waste of time in somebody life. Well at least my life it is. I think as a teen you sh old be to work on studying on doing your homework instead of being on the computer because I think it would be better to make sure your grade are not making you fail in your school Carver in life. So that is why it is best to make sure you aren't on the computer all the time talking to your friends on the computer all day because it could make you fail in life. I would only go on for a little bit to talk to your friends. That is why I think it is not right to spend all your time on the computer. Jump outside and in goal the outside weather with friends and family members. I hope teen and adult get outside from now on because it would be better for all of us and everybody would be deathly. If they Teri this program. If you Teri this program it will really work to all of you Teri prose it will work and you will be deathly and not feel bad about yourself."
4,"Computers are helpful in everyone's life. New things can be learned from them. They can provide a way to contact others. And they make writing a lot easier. Overall, they have a good effect on the world. Technology lets everyone explore new topics. If something is typed into @ORGANIZATION1, results will pop up within seconds. Click on these, and information that is needed is displayed. The computer is also helpful for research papers. The internet allows a more elaborate final draft. Learning benefits a grade in school or in work. It is always good to be able to contact anyone who is wanted. With the computer, people are Abel to @CAPS1, talk on @CAPS2, or even talk to a loved one on a web cam. On @CAPS2, pictures be added so anyone who wasn't able to be at an event can now see what is was like. Webcams hooked up to the computer let people talk face to face with someone else they might not have seen in months. These are all good examples of why computers have a positive impact on the human race. Writing out papers can be a hard, tedious task. On the computer, it is possible to type out words and not have to get out on eraser for an spelling mistakes. These are picked up by spell check. This way, no points are deducted for wrong spellings. Sometimes people @MONTH1 have sloppy handwriting. These difficulties can all be solved by a typing program on the computer. Therefore computers must have a positive effect on people. They teach new things. They allow people to contact others who are far away. They can also make grading a paper easy. This concludes that computers benefit the society we live in today."
4,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 it has been brought to my attention that why on a nice sunny day like this somebody would want to be inside. The sad truth is that too many people are wasting their time inside on their computers, rather than enjoying the day. Computers are negatively affecting the @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1 population. We are getting to a point where our whole world might be absolutely crazy if nothing is done about this. For one the @LOCATION1 has the most obese children in the world. Generally children should be running around burning off their calories; even some people in their teen years should. Instead kids are sitting in front of computer screens on their virtual games and emails and such. Even doing chores around the house could bring down the obesity rate a lot more then sitting on your butt staring at a screen all day. The whole screen thing brings me to my next point. Staring at those bright flashy lights for too long is not good for your brain, what computers cause @NUM1 out of @NUM2 child seizures a year. The radioactivity in a computer could also mess you up a lot by giving you cancer, with no cure for any cancer yet you have to figure that every time you are on that computer for too long you are putting your life at risk. The longer you re on the more and more and more radiation is going to you re brain. Do you really want to cut your life short knowing you are the one that did it to yourself, it could almost be called suicide because if you re reading this than you've been warned. So we've basically covered the effects that computers have on your body physically. The computer can also effect you mentally and socially. When @DATE1 comes along you will have all the time in the world to be on the computer but did you know over vacation you lose @PERCENT1 of everything you learned in school. Its been proven that computers cause memory loss. So what if you get back to school and you can't keep up with what's going on, frustrating isn't it? If you would've just read a book during the time you were on the computer maybe you could've gained knowledge rather than using it. Computers can affect you socially because not everybody wants to sit inside on the computer so while people are out having fun, you will be all alone, by yourself with nobody to talk to but a computer, would you like a computer to be your only friend? The debate about this topic could rage on and on for days and still have no winner but in all honesty when you go to turn on that computer think to yourself, is it really worth it? Think of everything you would lose, everything you could never get back, or would you rather do something that you would gain from in the future. Its your choice but be responsible enough to make the one that would benefit you."
4,"Dear Newspaper I think that computers havee a positive effect on people, here are my reasons. You can get in contact with people, if you havee a question you can look it up and you can do your job on a computer. I think that these reason will havee you positive too. Many people like computers and havee one. My first reason is you can get in to ch with friends and family. I think this is a good reason because if your grandmother lives in @LOCATION2 you dint want to drive there every time you want to see her when you live in @LOCATION1. You would use the computer to live chat with her so you wouldn't havee to drive all the Don there. If you wanted to you could plan a day to go and see her. You would use a computer to get in touch with friends. If you needed to ask them a question about the homework they could answer it. That is my first reason why computers havee a positive way on people. My second reason is if you havee a computer you can look up questions that you would havee. If you needed to know some thing for a big report and none of your friends are up you can look up your computer. Computers can help you so much if you need an answer. If you diet have a computer if you would be so hard to do stuff. That is why I think that computer can answer your questions. My third reason is you can work on the computer. If your a stay at home mom ya can work on the computer to handle finances. A lot of people work on the computer to save the endearment. When I grow up Ill probably work on the computer because it is easier. That is why I think that you can work on the computer. The reason I picked were you can get in touch with family and friends, you can look up a question that you might havee, and you can work on a computer. I hope you havee a positive way on computers they help you out. People might think that they not your brain not they dint help and knowledge you. Many people like and havee one. I think that you should havee a positive way on computers too."
4,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 people at my school sit on there computers after school. They don't go outside and enjoy nature. Visit with family and friends or even exercise. @CAPS2 people are affected by this. Going outside can en chance your knowledge, you can go on a walk in the woods. When you are on your walk you @CAPS2 find interesting new species. Also when you are outside you can play with your friends or siblings. @CAPS2 times in neighborhoods there are a lot of kids, you can start a pick of game of baseball. You can also build new things. You could find a big tree and build a tree house or tire swing with your family. Going outside leaves you with a lot of fun activities. When kids sit on the computer they don't interact with there family or friends. During the @DATE1 you can go to the beach with your friends. It will cool you down without having to pay money for an air conditioner. You @MONTH1 also find the opportunity to go to a different state for the day. Or you could go across the country to see your sick grandma or your newly named cousin. Going on a picnic will give you time to get to know new people. You could invite friends and have them bring a new friend for the whole group to met. You will also have a lot of tasty food and who wouldn't want that? Going places with your family and friends can pad to a worth wild experience. @PERCENT1 of kids chose to go on the computer than to exercise. Kids will become overweight. When on the computer @CAPS2 kids will eat. Eating for hours each day to not a good idea. You can go out for your schools basketball team or run distances in cross country. Once you are on the team you will make new friends, and get your exercise for the day. When you are on a team and exercising you will learn @CAPS2 life skills. You will learn the benefits of working as a team and by yourself. So getting your exercise is a very important role in your life. Why would you choose the computer? You wouldn't be able to enjoy the outdoors. Or spend time with family and friends. You would become over weight and unhappy. So, don't choose the computer, choose another activity!"
4,"To @CAPS1 @CAPS6 @MONTH1 concern: @CAPS2 I have been informed that you had the idea that more and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits the society. I strongly disagree, I think that computers have a positive effect on people. Having computers teach hand eye coordinationn, give people the ability to learn about @CAPS3 and faraway places and even allow people to talk online with friends or family. Don't you want your children to grow up with great hand eye coordination? More than @PERCENT1 parents voted yes. As shown in many statistics, adults and children that use the computer for an hour or more a day have better hand eye coordinationn than a normal adult or child that only uses @CAPS6 once a week. By using the computer for more than one hour a day your typing becomes quicker and your reactions increase. Not only does typing quicker effect your computer techniques but @CAPS6 also helps you outside of your home like in sports. For ex sample, if you play the sport baseball, the speed of your pitch will increase over @PERCENT2 if you use the computer for over a hour a day! If your a batter your reaction to the pitch will also increase by over @PERCENT2! Just by using computer. Is time running out for your @CAPS3 project to be do? Without computers, you wouldn't get the information you need quick enough. Dr. @DR1 from @ORGANIZATION1 state ""You can get the same information on people other countries, and @CAPS3 from the computer as you can . By using the computer you get the as a book and easy. In addition, you have to buy books to get their information unlike computers where they dint you look up the you and in expensive, dint settle for less get the best! Over @PERCENT3 of @CAPS4 have old friends of family out of the state that they would still like to keep in touch with. By having a computer you can chat with them through your web cam! Instead of calling them up or sending them an email you could chat with them and still see them in the flesh! Several computer owners say, ""@CAPS5 like your actually hanging out with them!"" @CAPS6 takes over @NUM1 days at least to receive a letter back or an email from them if they live faraway with computers @CAPS5 instant ! Wouldn't you like to talk to friends and family every day instead of waiting around for a call, email, or letter? I think yes. All in all , having computers is a great investment. I would also like to point out that without computers you wouldn't be able to talk with friends/family online, get better hand eye coordination, or even have the ability to learn about @CAPS3 in just a click of a button! Isn't this what you want? "
4,"Dear Newspaper editor, Have you ever been working on a paper, or reading something and threes that word you've never heard before? And you just cant figure it at? There where a computer can help you. Yes, some people do waste all their time, online but they have issues. Computers help us with all of our school projects and get research. You can @CAPS3 reconnect with old friends that you ha vent sen in years, learned many good things with the internet and computers. First off we would not be able to do some of the things we do without computers. @CAPS1 us school projects, I use @ORGANIZATION1 word and PowerPoint all the time. Our teachers prefer us to do that instead of handwriting Evert thing. Getting information on the computer is so much faster and easier I mean the time it would take, you to look up the word ""elephants"" the encyclopedia is probably @NUM1 times more that it takes to it in can Google. Plus there about @NUM2 1/@NUM2 seconds Google call all up millions of websites just what ""elephants"". Another reason way computers are very beneficial is you can reconnect the old friends you ha vent seen or talked for a years. You can @CAPS3 meet new @CAPS1 us dating and Facebook especially is three things and threes websites like twitter where you can follow celebrities and @CAPS2, computers are internet gives great information people. Some kids take online @CAPS3 @CAPS4 that does receives around computers to do really have a choice. So in conclusion, computers can be very beneficial to lets of people I know its not a good thing to sit there all day and play computer games, but we lets of things accomplished, like school projects, or any project really. Its @CAPS3 nice to meet up with someone you ha vent talked to in a while sometimes. We have learned many great things from the internet. I hop re you consider my opinion."
4,"Dear editor, Have you ever used a computer? Odds are you have, which means you know how convenient and positive computers are. Did you know @PERCENT1 of all @CAPS1 use computers regularly? These technological marvels provide many ways to communicate and learn, showing computers have an extremely positive effect on people. Who hasn't ever played a game on a computer? Computers provide many forms of entertainment, such as games, music, and videos. I once has to drive @NUM1 hours to see my grandma in @LOCATION1. The only thing that kept me away from the grasp of boredom during the trip was my portable computer, that I played games and watched movies on. Critics of computers argue that people who use computers do not ever participate in physical activities. Of course, try exercising when you are crammed in a car traveling @NUM2 @CAPS2, which is computers positively affect me. It was @NUM3 on a @DATE1 @TIME1, and my mother was just about to have a baby. Unfortunately, none of my relatives were there to witness this baby coming into the world because the all live on the other side of the @LOCATION2 @CAPS3, this minor set back did not prevent them from seeing the @LOCATION1 baby, and thanks to computers, they didn't even have to leave their homes. This is because computers offer many ways to be social, such as social networking sites. Within @NUM4 hours after the baby was born. there were many pictures and videos up on these social networking sites that let everyone enjoy my @LOCATION1 baby sister. Computers make life convenient for all. Last but not least, computers are not only a fine tool for school, but are necessary to succeed with your education. One snows day in @DATE2, I was assigned a research paper on @PERSON1. Too bad I didn't know one thing about @PERSON1, so I asked my mom to drive me to the library to take out some books for my report but due to the snow, the library's power went out and therefore they were closed. This was not an issue, though, because I only had to spend @NUM5 minutes on a computer searching for information, instead of spending hours browsing through countless pages in a book. Thanks to computers, I received an A on my report. Overall, computers serve many helpful purposes for people. These marvelous machines can provide entertainment, socialize with people around the world, and even provide information on any topic you would like. @ORGANIZATION1 readers, now you understand why computers are positive for your lives and everyone Elise's. I encourage all of you to spread this message to everyone, so they know all the benefits to using computers."
4,"Computers have many effects on people these days. Most of them are very good effects that can lead you to become more self confident. Computers can educate people, from learning about some ancient person to doing school projects. Also computers entertain people too. Lastly it can even increase you chances of finding a job or helping out your job. For most people education is very important to but since kids don't stay in school @NUM1 they use the computer to teach to kids kids can learn about other places. This benefits us because we're learning something and growing out our knowledge. Also kids can do their projects. For example writing on essay, their science fair project and so on. Lastly kids can learn about people from other times. For example famous musicians long ago, celebrities, legends, hall of fame rs etc. People always look for some kind of entertainment and the first place they ever go is the computer. Everyone likes entertainment and the computer in the the best plan. They could play a variety of games. Games from the past or games from the future. There is also a whole bunch of : multiplier, figure, castle defense, shale sports, racing, arcade, and so on. Another fun thing to do is interact with friends online or even talk to any family don't live near you. Lastly, you could watch funny videos, sad videos and music videos. Another that computers effect people is their of finding or help on their . the computer can teach people what they will do on their job, and what to expect. Also, it can let you search for jobs.

It can increase their education, give them entertainment, and even help out on their job, or help them find a job."
4,"These have been many advancements on computer technology and there are people who are for it and there are people who are against it. In against it and ill you why. You spend less time exercising which you'll gain weight. Spend less time enjoying nature which means you re lost with anything natural, an spend less time with friends and family which probably prove you, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 not saying the computer is a bad thing but to much of it certainly is. First, you spend less time exercising. you don't exercise you gain weight, you could do most of the stuff you could of , and you risk health. This is a bad thing because your not yourself anymore and if it goes to far you can't even a move. So if this sounds scary plan your time on the computer, so it doesn't happen to you, time is so limited that we waste it on stuff in computers so think before you go on the computer maybe you can go for a jog outside. Next, you spend less time playing nature. Nature is so beautiful but its being destroyed and we do nothing. There are only a few hundred maybe they said of us these truly help the environment, and if you think then few hundred of thousand people is alto . @NUM1.billion people of earth. Its a crying shame to see something so beautiful die, while most of us do nothing to help. Finaly, you spend less time with friends and family. This is the most important reason of all. The main course if you will of it all your family is so important because there your best friends whole wide world. Your friends important them. Your family might leave you if you your life to the computer if you they you so be car fully. Your friends are dust as important as your friends they both make you laugh. have good times and cheer you up when you upset. Just don't forget that as be gone. Well, there you have it my three reasons for being against work on the computer and they all sound like a good reasons so lets recap it all shall we. First, spend less time exerting, very important. Next spend less time enjoying nature, very important. Finaly less time with friends or family the most important of all. So hoped you enjoyed my essay and you've learned something . So remember to much of good thing is bad and I'll just leave you with . "
4,"Dear editor: @CAPS1 you know that @PERCENT1 of people in the @LOCATION2 have commuters? These computers are defiantly benefit ting society. People need computers to get updated on important issues, contact others and learn new information. Computers are necessary for everyday life. It's very important that news gets around, and one way for it to do that is by computers. Average people like me and you need to know the weather, global issues and many other important topics. If you use the computer to get updated on important issues you will be able to aces the information right away. For example there is no need to wait for the weather to come on the television when you can find out the weather for your local area wit hen seconds. Just recently there was an earthquake in @LOCATION1 and million of civilians died. if a natural disaster was to happen somewhere in @CAPS2 people would need to know and computers are a great way to make sure everyone is updated. Not only does the computer help us get important updates on global issues but it is also a great way to contact people. My relatives live very far away and we can't afford the long distance phone call charge and so we email them. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people contact far away friends and family by email! The computer is also a great place for friends to contact each other through social networking sites, such as @CAPS3, @CAPS4 and @CAPS5. People need to interact with other people and the internet is a fantastic place to do that. Finally computers can also be used to learn new information. If children need to find information for a project or essay the can easily search the internet and find an answer. Kids need to aces the information that is necessary for school on the internet. Computers are useful for adults as well. If adults want to learn something new all they have to to is search it on the computer. It's so much easier than going out to the library and finding that information in a book. @CAPS1 you know that most adults use an online dictionary to find the definition to a word? Computers can find every answer to your questions. In conclusion, computer are really benefit ting society. Computers can update you on important issues, help you contact people, and find out new information. These evinces in technology are good for human society."
4,"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 home computers is a good thing for many reasons. One reason is because people can use computers to learn about other countries and people. People can also use computers to type and save paper. Also, people can use computers to talk to people living close or far away from you. Finally, computers can save paper by replacing books. One @MONEY1 the most important reasons why people need computers is because computers can help you learn about and research other things going on in the world. If a student needs to research a country and write a paper about it for school, it is much easier and faster to use a computer than to look through a textbook.Computers are also better and faster than a textbook if you want to know more about a person or a culture. Using computers to type are also faster than writing a paper. Using a computer can save time and money when it comes to typing a paper. When you are typing a paper, you don't have to worry about @CAPS1 handwriting or breaking your pencil. You also don't have to worry abut spelling something wrong because computers can check you spelling and grammar. What you are writ ting a paper you have in about all @MONEY1 these problems and more. You also have to spend money on pencils and other writ ting supp plies. Computers also saved people @MONEY1 be case they didn't need to buy paper to make textbooks. Computers also evolved how people can communicate with each other. Before computers were invented, you couldn't talk to people in other countries unless you paid to use a phone or sent them mail. Now, you can send instant mail which saves days @MONEY1 time and paper. You can also use web cams to talk to family members and people you don't know. That can save you a lot @MONEY1 money because you don't have to pay money for postage stamps, phone calls, or plane rides to visit them. Those are some @MONEY1 the best reasons why @CAPS1 a home computer is better than not @CAPS1 one. A home computer can save you time when you want to research a country, person, or culture. They can save you money because you don't have to buy postage stamps, pay for phone calls, or pay for plane rides to visit someone from a different state or country. Computers also help save paper because you no longer need to make large textbooks or use a different price @MONEY1 paper when you make a writ ting mistake."
4,"In my opinion I agree that it benefits society. The reasons that support my decision are lots of businesses use computers to work, fast food restaurants use computers, and schools use computers. Computers are all needed just for those reasons. My first reason is businesses use computers to work. Workers use computers for designing, filing peoples names, and to type papers, and essays. People in the designing industry don't use paper and pencil anymore, because they use designing soft wares to work. Instead of filing in a cabinet people and workers use computers to put their patients, clients, and workers. Computers can hold more information and files than cabinets can. People also type papers and essays for work. For example, news reporters have to write a report and type it for their company in order to get it to publish. If workers in business were to need to use computers to file, type, and design clothes and games. My second reason is that fast food restaurants or even restaurants use computers, instead of using cash registers. For example @ORGANIZATION2 or @ORGANIZATION1 use technology to type in peoples orders, and amount they pay. Back then they used to use cash registers, in order to get money out they need to click a button, but now the have all locked up using computers. Every restaurant has at least a touch screen computer in it to use. So restaurants need computers to survive the world. My third reason is schools need computers for students and teachers to write reports, file the students name and grades into it. Students in classes write reports for projects or even for class work. Teachers need computers to file the students name, grades, and information, instead of using a cabinet. Teachers also use computers to make homework pages and they need to print stuff off of word. So schools use and need computers for students and teachers use. In conclusion I agree that computers benefit society, because businesses need them to work, design, and file, and fast food restaurants so they can take peoples orders and to use in schools for students and teachers use. So that's why it benefits the society."

The first reason why computers are bad because @CAPS11 @CAPS3 cause addition to your child. @CAPS12 a problem because your child bother you and say, ""@CAPS1 or @CAPS7 @CAPS3 I go on the computer place"". And you say yes and when you let tho on they will be happy when you say.

4,"Dear @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1, Computers are an extremely use full tool in this modern age. They teach hand eye coordination, give people the ability to easily learn about faraway places and people, and allow people to talk online with other people. Therefore, I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Handeye coordination is a very important skill for young children to master. Without it they will have sloppy handwriting, absolutely no chance at sports, and much more. Computers help teach them because they need their finger to hit the same key that their eye sees. And because they tend to want to type faster, it will help even more because the finger and eye will have to work in mission to type faster. Computers also give people the ability to easily learn about far away places, people, etc. People used to have to spend hours searching for a half decent book on a topic, and then find the specific information they need in the hundreds of pages. Now that information is only a few clicks away. Say you have had problems with your faucet, it keeps drippy but you dint want to pay for a plumber. You could easily step by step instructions on what to do using the computer, the possibilities are endless. Finnaly, Computers can allow people to stay in contact with friends who @MONTH1 live far away. It is more convenient than using a plane because you dint have to have something in your hands the whole time. You can walk away and then came back when you hear that you got a message. It is also very use full for people such as businessmen because they can talk to multiple people at once while still being able to get other work done, @PERSON1, author of business magazine tells us in an interview that it is nearly impossible to run a successfully business without a computer. How people could possibly say that computers have a negative influence on society, I dint know. But I hope that you will publish this in the paper and show them that computers are necessary."
4,"There are over @NUM1 students at @ORGANIZATION2. & out of @NUM2 students have computers. Computers have a positive effect on people. Students who use computers are more skilled than kids who don't by learning all the software and hour to be safe when online. Computers teach kids hand eye coordination, which can come in handy when playing sports. Also they give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. Finally it allows people to talk online with other people. Computers make people develop hand eye coordination. When someone plays a sport live baseball or basketball, hand eye coordination is definitely needed. say your a catcher, and then catch it. Almost every sport needs hand eye coordination and computers help you get it. Handeye coordination can also be useful to people with jobs. If you work with computers for a job, it is helpful to be well known wit the keyboard for fast results. Mostly any job along with sports requires hand eye coordination. Some people have the gift that they have hand eye coordination when there born, but for people who don't practice is the best thing. Learning about faraway places/ people is always fascinating. On computers towns can put up web pages with pictures, information or even ways to help you plan a vacation. Theres also @ORGANIZATION1. @ORGANIZATION1 can help you find any place or you can find out anything about that place. Computers even give you the ability to plan or visit a lock lockation by buying tickets online or maybe you just want to read what the place is like, you can do all that. Finally, computers can be taken any place with you and say you go to @LOCATION1, and you don't speak there language, well you can go to a translating site and figure out what things mean. Facebook, @CAPS1, @CAPS2, all of these sites make it possible for you to talk with other people. Personally, I have a Facebook, aim, and even a email. A lot of the time I will go on Facebook and talk to my friends from school and even my cousins that I don't get see a lot. Talking online helps you interact with other people that you might not see in school or around town, and also your friends that might not have a cell phone. It helps you learn social skills that everyone needs. Computers give you all that. Its easy and free way to talk to anyone you know whenever you want. In conclusion, computers have a positive effect on people. Almost everyone uses computers, and they aren't difficult to use. Computers teach hand eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Computers are one of the best things that has ever been made."

This is completely untrue and in many ways actually benefits society. The internet is d fast d simple way to shorten the time spent doing activities we would already do. Instead of sending d letter to someone to invite them to the @CAPS3 you could just email them. Letters can take weeks and can even get lost while email sends it to them instantly. Also what if the movie sells out or is canceled, don't worry with the internet you can reschedule and buy tickets online. So that doesn't happen again. Suddenly your phone rings, its d call from your best friend saying to turn on the news, but you have to leave to pick up your kids in three minutes. Instead of waiting for the reports to stop talking and , you can check instantly on one of the many news websites and still be early. Have you been deign to talk to someone haven't seen in a long time. Well with one of the many free websites like @CAPS4 and Facebook go can do ht at in d heart beat. You can talk to that person and find many race. Also if you've been feeling lonely, like you can't find the right person. With dating sites you can find the perfect person and maybe go to the @CAPS3 with them. Not only does it save time and connect you to other people but it can help you physically. Acording to trashing at @ORGANIZATION1 people who use computers for at least @NUM1 mint es a day have d @PERCENT1 increase in hand EU coordination rel action time and accuracy. Although home say it's bad for your EUes that is a lie, it was proven by @PERSON1 the @CAPS5, be stead of health who has @NUM2 deg res in science and health."
4,"@ORGANIZATION1, In my opinion computers are good for people. I believe this because many people get to see things that on their daily basis wouldn't. I think that computers have a positive effect on people. I think that many people now a days work alto so "
4,"@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 a world without computers. Where would we get all of our information from? Would we have to Raleigh on television or magazines, where information can be changed? Or how would we ever get any reports done for work or home work? I know"
4,"Dear local Newspaper. I think we should keep improving technology on computers. Some people think that people spend too much time on the computer and not enough time outside. I personally think that the computer is important, if people don't use it none stop. There are many reasons what the computer is important. First of all there are many places in the world that not everyone can go to. The internet is a good way to find out about a place. Also if you are going on vacation and you would like to know Little about the vacation spot you can just look it up on the computer. Another reason is the computer can help you study a place too. Also if you are writing a research paper for school then you would probably want to find your information on the computer. If you are disagreeing with someone than you can find quick and easy information. All you do is look up something and you can find it. And you can learn new things that you have no clue about. Most of the time the internet is very helpful. One more reason is communication. On the computer there are many ways you can communicate with other people. If you have friends or family far away then you can keep in touch with them without leaving your house. Also if you are not sure about homework or something like that you can just ask a friend to find out. And you can send pictures or videos to people in order to keep in touch. Sometimes people use that feature for bad or inappropriate things. But you can do something about it so you don't get those bad things. The internet can help you alto in your every day life. You can learn about new places, you can do research, and you can communicate with friends or family. If we keep improving technology you will be able to do alto more than you can do now. The internet will be able to help you alto more in your every day life. Now you can see that the internet can help people and its not just keeping people inside that is why I think we should keep improving technology."
4,"Dear Newspaper, I personally believe that new technology is a great thing. Thats why I think that computers have positive effects on our society. Some of these effects include developing skills to help people for present or future, getting a better education and helping people to become more social. Computers can help people in so many ways you just have to realize it. So come and see why computers are a good choice to have and use. My first reason of why I feel computers have positive effects on people is because they can help develop skills that one has and @MONTH1 not realize. For example a teenager @MONTH1 say while typing a paper that she really likes to write. So, she @MONTH1 go on the internet start looking at different styles and maybe she could become a famous journalist. It's all from the skills she got going online and searching what she enjoys. Another situation could be that a man applies for a job and then the employer' says he has to know how to use different soft wear, so he could go on the computer and look for a tutorial on that specific soft wear. A computer @MONTH1 help people build skills now and for their own future. My second reason of why computers can have positive effects on people is that it can help them get a better education. Any adult who hasn't gone to college and wants to can take classes online and earn their degree way. The education is just for adults; kids can go online and research history of different places they live and want to go. The great thing about you is you can find the information fast and easy. Computers help people learn more and get a better education for themselves. My final reason of why computers have positive effects is that they help people to be more social. There are so many ways to connect with family and Friends. You can send an email to someone and wait for a reply. Or now, you can even instant message somebody and talk to them like there in the same room. There are also websites, such @CAPS1 Facebook, where you can get together and talk with old friends. Computers can help everyone connect with anyone @CAPS1 you can see computers have so many positive effects on people. They can help you build social skills for now and for our future. They can also help people get a better education. Plus, it is a great way to connect with past and present friends. Hopefully you can see how a computer can have positive effects on so many people."
4,"On today's society many new technology's have been released. Such as the @NUM1 player, cell phone, video game counsels such as box @NUM2 but probably the most popular and most used is the computer. The ability. and search information in just a couple of clicks. Some people are with technology that they almost get addicted to it and use it every chance they get. Is this good for people is what there doing affecting there health and physical activity. Yes, people these days are affect by the internet greatly. Such websites in once the addiction highly such as Facebook, MySpace, and YouTube. These are probably the is for school. In the @NUM3 years seance Facebook. the level increased dramatically and so have the high pressure level! Dr. @DR1 says. This online behavior must stop people are getting addicted and gaining wait from the lock of physical activity. As you can see the online internet can be very use but not something that should be used non stop it can affect you health and bring other dangers."
4,"Hi! I am writing in which computers are a bad thing to the society or good thing. I think that computers are good thing to have around. They help us in a lot of way and they also help us find new friends and new updates. This is going to be my first opinion. I think that computers have effects on the society in a good way because people can find @CAPS1 of the latest updates on the weather, society and country's. It helps the society in a good way because people don't have to look though an old Newspaper. All they have to do is click and there there reading it all and pro bally seeing pics and stuff of it. This is my second reason why computers are a good effect on the society they help us in a lot of ways on which meeting new people and staying in close good with them and talking with them and sending pics of stuff and you. My last opinion for computers are a good effect on society is that @CAPS2 you have a business or anything you can sell any of your merchandise, keep business plans, And also you can make a website for your business after a while @CAPS1 of people will know about it and it would make a really big in pack on your business. That was my three opinion on which why computers are good effect on the society and I think that computers are really good effect on the society."
4,"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you think that computers have a positive or negative affect on people's lives? Well if you think it is negative I am going to show you why it is actually very positive. First, it teaches good hand eye coordination. Second, it lets people communicate with other people. Third, it can help with school and work. As you can see this is why I believe it is positive. First, computers teach good hand eye coordination. While you use computers you are improving your hand eye coordination. One way is that when you are online and you see something you like or want to see even bigger, you move the mouse and click. This helps because you saw something and didn't need to see where you were moving the mouse to click on it. Also it helps because when you are typing a paper you don't need to look at the keys to know what to type. You can look at the screen and move your fingers freely. As you can see this is my first reason as to why I believe computers are positive. Second, computers help people communicate with others. This can be important if you need to talk to someone that lives far away. If someone lives to far away and their is something important then the @CAPS7 is great. You can send people @CAPS3 or even @CAPS4 chat someone. It helps communication so much that you have choices on how you want to talk to someone. Third, it helps people with school and sometimes work. It helps people because they could @CAPS2 projects. This can be helpful to learn about places you didn't even know existed. One time I was wondering what people from @LOCATION1 did to live and survive. Being @CAPS5, I just had to know. I went on the computer and in about a half hour I knew exactly what and how @CAPS5 people did to live and survive. This could also help at work because it your boss is counting on you to have work done, you can use the @CAPS7. As you can see this is my third and final reason as to why I believe computers are positive. In conclusion, I believe that computers are positive for three main reasons. First, they can help to improve hand eye coordination. Second, they help people communicate with people from other areas. Third, it helps with school and work. So now that you have read this I hope I have shown you that computers aren't bad for us at all. In fact the are the best bet for a better future."
4,"Dear local Newspaper, I hear you are whether or not computers have a positive effect on people. In my opinion, i think that, yes, they do have a positive effect on people. I think this because @NUM1. Computers allow you to learn about foreign places and cultures. @NUM2. Computers are often helpful to those with special needs, and @NUM3. The computer allows you to connect win people who @MONTH1 live faraway with out having to travel to them. I really enjoy learning about foreign places and culture. I know that from my own experience that the more knowledgeable you are about foreign places and culture. The more smart you become overall. Without the computer, many people would not be able to explore these places and learn about them. The computer is basically a big encyclopedia that supply's important information to those who are unable to travel across the world and visit these places. Without computers, people would be less educated about the people, cultures, and the world we live in . Places such as pyramids in in @LOCATION1, and . Don't you agree? In my school there are several students with special needs. I, personally, can't even begin to imagine how difficult it must be for them to learn. But one thing i do know is that the computer is a very helpful resource to them. The computer supplies pictures, sounds, and interactive activities that really help kids out. Since some of the kids in my school who have special needs have a hard time reading. The computer helps by reading it aloud to mom. Where would those children be if they didn't have computers? I love keeping in touch with my dis tent family and friends. Don't you? It used to be that it would take days and days to send and receive a letter from relative. @MONTH1 because of the computer, hard task can be done with a simple click of the mouse. But that's not all. Besides sending virtual email to people, because of the computer, you see them face to face! Some computers have web cams that allow you to see someone through the screen of your computer, isn't that great?! So, why waste money flying to see someone to deliver a simple message when you can deliver it personally in almost less than @NUM4 seconds? Becaose of the computer, people talk more and are often brought closer together. So, as you can see there are many important positive effects that computers have on people. The reasons being @NUM1. computers allow you to learn about foreign places and cultures. @NUM2. computers are often helpful to those with special needs. And @NUM3. computers allow you to connect with people who @MONTH1 live faraway without having to travel to them. Thank you for listening."
4,"More and more people use computers everyday. Computers are a great help for projects, email, vacation spots, and so on. However, some scientists think people are spending too much time on the computer instead of exercising, or taking a walk. I think that computers are an important part of a persons life because the information found on a computer is very useful. It can be useful to you when you have a report coming up. What if your teacher tells you that a report is due tomorrow? What are you going to do, you don't have time to go to the library. I would go on the computer and get all the information I need. I would also use a computer to learn about far away places, or even famous people in history. I also could look up where I'm going on vacation and then I could learn more information about it. Like, you could find where the best restaurant locations are, the best hole rs, and even the best tourist spots. Computers are also helpful for charting. My grandparents moved so I don't talk to them that much anymore, but since I have a computer I can send a quick email saying hi, or asking how they're doing. Also imagine going to work and not having a computer! Thats a lot of work to write down! At some works, the work consists of emailing other work members about the problems they are having, and about meetings. By using a computer you can keep up to date on everything that's going on. Also computers are helpful because if you had a test to study for, and you forgot your notes at school, you can look up online what you are studying. Then you can study from the computer. So then the next day you won't fail the science test. Computers can be a nice little break after all your homework is done. If you want to go on the computer to talk to your friends, it should be an incentive to get all your homework done first. Sometimes people need some down time after all their homework is over with. Playing games on the computer can be a nice way to relax. Computers are a great help for reports, vacations, chatting, information to help you study for a test. Also to play games on. A lot of people use computers to do work on for their jobs. I think computers are an important part of a persons daily life."
4,"Do you like computers? Do you use the internet to help you? Do you use it every day? Well @CAPS1 not this article gives you information about all of this. First, alto of people don't like computers because they say ther're to confusing. Actually computers are'nt that hard to work you just have to be patient and take some time to get used to it. Also, computers can make things easier like typing. why should you right @CAPS1 you have the option to use a computer which lets you write faster than you could on normal paper. Secondly the internet is very easier then books. All you have to do is go to @ORGANIZATION1 any other search engine type what your looking for in and in a split second you have all the information in the world on that topic. Also @CAPS1 your planing a vacation the internet can help. You can purchase plane tickets online and sometimes there are special discounts doing the web. Also, you can back hotels and look at live pictures with more than just . So when you back a vacation on the internet you know it will be a good one. Finally, you can purchase anything with a click of a button. Almost every website has discounts. I remember the time when I bought @MONEY1 shoes @MONEY2 online. Also it usually ships to your house in a couple of days . Lastly going on it alto isn't bad. I go oh the computer almost every day but also go outside too. I can do this because at night when one one can go outside I go on the computer for school or for fun. Also, you can talk to your friends or family over the internet. What @CAPS1 your mom or dad went on a @NUM1 weeks business trip. You could use your web cam and talk to them and see than like @CAPS1 you were in the same room. So is going on the computer really so bad? I don't think so @CAPS1 it is that helpful and easy to work with."
4,"Dear newspaper company, More and more people use computers each day. But not every one agrees it benefits society. Some people say the people that are on computers dint get exercise or play outside. Then when they get off the computer their eyes hurt and they cant see as well. But will all that said I agree with the benefits of computers is very well used. The reasons why I agree with computers have benefits is that. It gives you hand eye coordination give people info on faraway places. They can also rent hotels movies and games. You can even talk to people online from around the world! What if we didn't have computers though then what if a serious crime hap pend then we wouldn't be able to find the criminals name or his records! Some bad reasons for having computers is a big issue right bellying! Kids might get picked. On and he will. People get called names all the time. Another big problem is online they seem friendly then they try to. There is two big problem with computers its called plagiarism. Plagarism is when you take some ones work and put your name on the. It can be also be when you steal and say its yours. The second problem is stealing music getting it for free. By downloading from the internet like lime wire. Then the the song dint get the money from the albums. That is why I agree with computers give you benefits. They give you bad ones to careful when your on a computer."
4,"Dear all computer lovers, i do think you are all spending too much time on the computer. yes, it is good to go on the computer and learn new fact, watch funny videos, and also basically everything is on the computer these days. But most people spend to much time on the computer. you need to be doing three things, enjoy nature spending time with famil and friends and most importantly, exercise. In this letter I will be explain why you need these things, which you cant get on the computer. First, i will be explaining why it is important to enjoy nature. Sometimes, enjoying nature can be difficult but if we all look closer it can be really fun. Some examples of nature are trees, grass, the fresh air. But I am sure all of my fellow teenagers would agree that, that is very boring we would all rather sit and watch TV. Some examples of making of making nature fun is instead of looking at a boring tree, you can climb the tree and maybe you can go outside and play with your dog and lay in the grass. One example of my favorite things to do in nature, is when I say up all night I run outside very early and lay in the grass, breathe in the fresh air and watch the sun came up. Secondly, and every important that you get off the computer and spend time with famil and friends. Fa mil, can do @MONTH1 things with you and I know that I am very happy when I am with famil because they always make me laugh and most importantly my famil loves to party. Partys are always fun especially when your are with famil. Freinds are also great to be with because they make you laugh have adventures and are always there for you."
4,"Deear Newspaper, I think that the effects that computers are having on people is a @CAPS1 thing because most people just sit at the computers all day long. In this letter I am going to talk about the effects of computers on people, what we could be doing instead, and what person are doing on the computer. First thing is that computers are having a @CAPS1 effect on people and there life computers are making people just fit inside on their computers all day and do nothing. They just sit there playing games also about @PERCENT1 of the people who are spending to much time on the computer are pro bally pa ting well their on the computer which that is why some people @MONTH1 be fat. Most of the people who spend all of they time on the computer is people in there @NUM1's and @NUM2's some are in there @NUM3's or @NUM4's. Just sitting there on the computer will get you. Where in life. It will not give you a job or school education. By just sitting at the computer for a while you will not be able to do things out side. If so many people were not on the computer all the time then they could be outside. Being outside they can play sports, ride bikes, swim, run and more. They could also get a job and make some money or go to college, kids who are on the computer to much could get out and go to the mall, hang with friends you could get some exercise, or just enjoy nature. There is no use for going on the computer and being there for more then @NUM5 or @NUM6 hours, the most you should be on the computer would be an hour to an hour and a half. Kids and teenagers should only go on the computer for homework and the rest of the time doing something eels. Well all of the kids grade through @NUM7 grade should go out a play with their toys and people @NUM8 grade and up should hang out with and do thing like go to the mall, see a movie, or just have a sleepover. Also everyone in these grades should interact with there families more by seeing them more then @NUM7/@NUM8 times a month and they could have parties or just get together and hang out. So people should do some of the other things I said instead of just going on the computer all of the time. The last thing is the things that people are doing on the computers which is like I sometimes go on Facebook. Other people go on Facebook, Google, games looking up information, and more. They also have emails where they chat with other people. Another thing people go on is YouTube and listen to music and watch videos. So I don't think that the effect of the computers on people is a good thing. I think that people shod be out doing things then just sitting at home on the computer. People who sit at home on computers could and pro bally will get to fat. So the effect of computers on people is @CAPS1."
4,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion on computers is that I think they are the most helpful thing in our society and it benefits us greatly. Lets say if I wanted to see what across the world looks like, or even what the surface of the moon, mars, Venus, Jupiter, etc. I could just go onto a computer open or download a program a there it is. Computers also help people express there creativity by here a program that aloes you to draw or build. I bet the even help young children became smarter by building things on the computer. Another things computers do is open lots of jobs and in a bad economy people need all the help they can get. With a computer you can keep people alive and breathing you can find broken bones or tumors, you can build Bridges, homes by making blue prints. The last thing computers help us do is the most import en and that is helps people learn. By making simulation of the titanic a space ships or the floor. They help find information even if its about people you can see people on a computer with a camera for or save a life by fin were they creased on there plane or. Thats why computers are the most helpful thing we have @DATE1 and we should keep learning and progressing to make us more advance and smarter."
4,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I think that computers have a positive effect on people. You can do lots of stuff with computers such as help people learn new things almost about everything. Also, there are some programs on the computer where they allow you to talk to other people. Also, for adults, they can take care of some finances and bills online and some taxes. I think computers definitely have a positive effect on people. A lot of people use their computers to learn new stuff about other things and people. Nine out of ten people go on the computer at least more than once a month to learn about something new. Also, kids in school use computers all the time for school work and to learn about new things. Kids in school use computers in school all the time for projects and experiments and they learn new stuff about people and things in the world. Computers definitely have a positive effect on people when they learn new things. Another great things about computers is that there are programs that allow you to talk to other people. Eight out of ten people talk to another person almost every day on the computer. This is a good thing because they re able to talk to friends and family from a long distance and enjoy themselves. It is also a good thing because if family moves away you can still talk to them from a computer. Another positive effect computers have for you is that adults can pay bills and finances on the computer also. Seven out of ten adults pay bills online at their computer. This is a good thing because adults have to do it by hand, now they can just do it on the computer, which is definitely a positive effect on a person! I think computers definitely have a positive affect on people in many ways. They help people learn new stuff about things and. Also, they allow you to talk to friends and family over the internet. And finally, they allow you to do finances and pay the bills online instead of by hand. There are many ways still computers have a positive affect on people, Ive only stated just a few of them. I hope you take my side about my opinion about computers and that they definitely have a positive affect on people."
4,"There are all kinds of computers, but they all do the same thing. Computers help people with anything they need. Such as, you can go online and chat with people, you can buy and sell things, you can go to college, you can learn anything, and it helps you type up your homework neatly. I personally think Thait computers are very helpful and we are lucky to have them. Going online can give you so many opportunities for anything. From going to college online when you don't have the time to go in person to just talking to your friends. You can learn just about anything on the computer and it's just so much fun. The computer to most people I know is the greatest invention besides the obvious ones. Going to college online is so easy. There isn't alto to it. Alot of people in the country online for college. For instance, paren'ts Thait want to go back but can't go in person or someone who has alto of work but cant fit in the time to actually go to college. But they can go online and take classes on their free time. Also, talking to friends online is fun too. When you aren't at a friends house you can chat with them online. Maybe you can go on @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 or @CAPS3 or even your email. There are many ways to do it on Thai fabulous computer. The computer is also jam packed with loads of information Thait is helpful to anyone in the world. You can learn about different countries, people, or even the recipe of apple pic. Who knows what you can learn. The computer has things for every person in the world. Since we are all different. Some of us like to buy or sell things on the computer or do our homework. Maybe even just a fun computer game is nice. Every person in the world is different, but we have one thing in common. The world knows we need computers and computers are the smartest thing since the calculator. Buying and selling things on the computer is easier Thain it looks. All you have to do is put what you want to sell online or look online what you want to buy. Then you buy it or sell it. There is more to the process like the @ORGANIZATION1 people bring or take it to or away from you. But Thait just the basics. You can also do your homework neatly on the computer if you have a messy handwriting. Therefore, the computer has so many things Thait can benefit you and the world with everything it has to offer."
4,"I do not agree that computers benefits society. There are threes big reason why computers are bad, people are getting to attached and aren't spending time with there families. Others are gaining weight because they stay on the computer, and not exercising. Also some people aren't getting fresh air not getting out for a wALk in a park. Computers are making people shut out their families. When a girl wants to play with her big sister the big sister will just shut out the little sister and continue emailing her friends on the computer. Families need to stick together but when a member of the family from doing a family picnic or other family activities. Computers have addictive games that a person will play and ignore everyone and sometimes a family member can go into depression because he or she is being ignored. Another reason computers are bad is because of heALth issues. People will get to addicted and be lazy. They will just sit in the computer chair and eat drink bad stuff ALl day. People would gain weight might ever get diabetes from the weight. If people don't get the exercise they need to stay heALthy then they might have heart problems, and many more serious conditions. If your weights gets to extreme then you might not be able to lose weight because your body has gotten TV used to ALl the weight your heart @MONTH1 not be able to take it. At last but not least people will stop going outside and not go and wALk or tALk, with friends. People should AL least go outside once a day to see nature get air. They should go to the beach relax and relieve ALl the stress from computer games. Having to much stress is bad for your heALth you might go into depression. Being on the computer way to much can be bad if you sit in the dark not getting sunlight it can be bad for your eyes. So as you can see there is ALot of bad things about computer. Most of the problems or issues ALl have to do something with someones heALth. So this is why I think this is bad for the society's benefits. I hope that you will take these reasons to heart. Thank you!"
5,"Dear @CAPS1 Newspaper, @CAPS2 when you were a kid? There weren't any computers or other electronics except the telephone. The computer is very advanced and helps people in many different ways, such as: hand eye coordination, learning and being able to talk online. These things benefit society and prove the advancement in technology. The computer teaches hand eye coordination when people don't even realize @CAPS5, through typing whether typing an email or an essay your hands are working and helping you. The hand eye coordination that people learn on a computer can be used for sports. @PERSON3, a @NUM1 years old tennis player, said, ""I used to go on the computer everyday and play tennis later, and eventually the computer helped use with my favorite sport."" Handeye coordination is very useful, for many things our surveyed @NUM2 people and @NUM3 of these people say that hand eye coordination is a very important still and that everyday activities, such as computers, help them improve. Typing is very com only used while sending emails because they are fast, fun, and let you communicate. When talking on a computer there are many new ways that are popular and fast, such as email welcomes aim, Facebook and many more. @CAPS5 is nice to be able to talk to friends and family online because other options are more expensive. For example, many live on @LOCATION1 and her sister, @PERSON4, she is very close to, lives in @LOCATION3. They can't talk to each other a lot because neither of their calling plans allow them to call without charging hundreds of more money. They also can't fly to use each other because plane tickets are expensive these days. Also, the economy isn't doing that great, so they couldn't stay in touch until web cams come out. Now, they see each other almost every week. Many said, ""I was considering flying to @LOCATION3, but now the web cams and email are useful and save us both a lot of money."" People @MONTH1 argue that you can just sent letters to each other, but, you can't send your baby boys first steps that you just video taped, or a YouTube video that is really cute. Also, you can meet new people online that you @MONTH1 not've seen normally and when you can stay in touch, you can stay much closer to each other. Even though computers are great for fun, working and learning are much easier online. When online, everything that can be learned is amazing whether @CAPS5's what means or the earthquake in @LOCATION4. Being able to keep track of everything in one computer is amazing. @PERSON2, a @NUM4 @CAPS3 teacher at @LOCATION2, says, ""@CAPS4, we are trying to make more things electronic to protect the planet, so use don't waste paper and will trees."" @CAPS5 is true, about @PERCENT1 of the homework of @NUM5 graders is online, whether @CAPS5 is to look up the equation for photosynthesis on to find out what year @CAPS6 died in being online does help the environment @CAPS5 is important to be able to have computers in schools because @CAPS5 gives more chances for kids to learn more things faster, like @NUM6 graders have a math class online, off hey math. @CAPS5 gives people more information coming from more people. Online, you can read a scientists' experiment or a paparatzi's take on @PERSON1' new boyfriend. The computer has changed society a lot, for the better. Now, in the @DATE1, computers are part of the everyday lives of people in which they benefit. With better hand eye coordination, being able to talk your friends, and being able to learn the computer benefits society."
5,"Dear local newspaper, I'm sure you love kicking back and surfing the web. Afterall, the internet is an amazing invention. However, the truth of the matter is that some people spend way to much time on the computer. We miss out on all the other important things in life, just because of to much time on our laptops. Excessive use of the internet can lead to not enough exercise. It can cause us to be antisocial, And lastly, not allow us to enjoy the beautiful nature that surrounds us. Do you know that a very high cause of obesity is? Electronics, kids sit on the computer all day long, while they should be out exercising and keeping fit. Sure, it is still okay to surf the web. You just have to keep the time minimum we could ensure this rule by having a time limit set at home. I myself love to use the computer, but i make sure to get off after about an hour. The whole idea of the ""internet"" is such a broad topic. That leaves us with so much to explore, we just have to keep on eye on the clock. There are so many forms of chat on the internet; @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION1, etc. Many people are always on one of those, instead of talking in person. We can eventually become antisocial due to so much time spent on the computer. Although yes, you can be talking over the internet, it is necessary to be talking to people face to face, it is as if we become greed to the computer. Websites such as @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 are also causes of this. People get addicted and are on them constantly, @CAPS4 ""@CAPS5"" websites actually take away time that could be spent with friends. So instead of having a chat over the computer screen, plan a meeting in person. Don't allow the computer to let you loose the social skills that you have built up. I love going outside each season to see the beautiful nature that surrounds us if you spend to much time on the computer, you wont have time to enjoy it. There are so many thing that you would be missing out on. Take time out of you day that you would normally spend on the computer to take a walk outside. Things out her are so much prettier than you computer screen, trust me. once you cut down you computer time deliberately, you will realize all the other things that are more worth you time. So the next time you think about going to surf the web or play that new computer game, i hope you think about my opinions i presented to you. Too much time on the computer causes us to not get enough exercise, and we can become antisocial. we won't be able to enjoy the nature around us. Computer time is fine in moderation, you just have to be aware of how much time you spend on it. Hopefully, my supported reasons have given you another view on surfing the web."
5,"Have you ever gone on the computer? Have you ever sat there on the computer for a long time?

For example, whenever I forget homework or have about school works I can reach my peers and get help in a matter of. Not only can I seek help from otherrs on my computer but I can stay in touch with my friends and family. So those who think computers cause us to spend less time with family and friends are mistaken.

5,"Dear @CAPS1, Computers are a great invention! They allow you to do so many different things. They have alto of positive effects on people. Computers deal with all sorts of things, from hand eye coordination, learning about faraway places and people, to talking online with anyone. Come on in to the wonderful world of computers. Computers have a super positive effect on people. They help teach hand eye coordination. You can look at the screen without having to look down at your hand to move the mouse. You can see where it's going just by looking at the screen. Doing this helps everyday skills like playing sports. If you can use your eyes and your hands at a you can hit a baseball or even. Computers teach hand eye coordination by being able to do two things at. Would it be amazing if you could just find a recipe go to? Well, you You could simple A computer helps people different things. It's also easy different culture, people, and places. Let's say you @CAPS2 and you. A computer gives you any learn something. Computers and almost everyday. They give you @CAPS3 instance, @CAPS4 is a great way to talk to people. You can chat with people typing. Further sites like @CAPS5, @CAPS6 or @CAPS7 where you have you own page post your own opinions. You also have friends page to see how you are doing. These sites give people a chance to find with old friends. Webcam is becoming a huge sensation! Sites like or Skype let you see and talk to the other person. They allow you to talk to people that you @MONTH1 and feel that they are there with you. Computers benefit people all over the world. but that doesn't. Computers help people physically by being able to learn new things, and with being able to computers aren't taking over are only helping them."
5,"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 do you feel about computers? I know that I think they are a great to we are lucky to have them. They have to be used in moderation though, because exercise and staying healthy is good. I hope you will share my opinions in your next article to help pursued readers on my view of computers. What I believe is the best thing about computers, is that it is a great source to learn. The internet can connect all over the world, and you can learn about other cultures. You can know everything about that country without ever visiting! Or you can use it to find out about you family's history. Many record keeping systems are switching to computers now. When we took a field trip to @LOCATION1 they had data bases there that had every name of the people that went through there. Studies show that @NUM1 people find the internet easy to use, and quicker than any method. Another thing about computers is they help you in the work place. Lets say you had a job designing houses to be built. In old times you would have to draw it out by hand using numerous instruments and tools, but now you could make the design using just one tool, the computer. It is a much away way to to you job and if assists the customers because before if the wanted the house to be a different you would have help to draw it all over again. Now you just have to make an adjustment on the computer and in seconds its done with the new design. These day if not @PERCENT2 then @PERCENT1 of house designers use computers. Computers also play in a social role. On the internet you can connect and chat with friends. Also you could share pictures of both of you at a baseball game @DATE1 to keep memories. Or you can send them a website with a really funny video of someone getting with a soccer ball. Experts did a study and it showed that @NUM2 times the rearsn a teen goes on the internet is to connect with friends. ""@CAPS2 @PERSON1 (computer expert and developer) what do you think the number one rears teen use computers teen use computers is?"" @CAPS3, I would have to say to chat with friends. I dint see why they wouldn't, it's simple and almost in ."" Computers are, a great advancement in our technology. They assist us in everyday life, life and make difficult tasks simple. They should not be over used though and you need to keep a healthy mind and body. All of the thing we could learn from them though help in the argument of that. To me the computer is the same step forward as the light bulb was. Computer source found @PERCENT3 of in @LOCATION2, and. I believe they will be in all of our homes. Some families find them @CAPS2 useful the have more than one in the household. They can come in all shapes and sized to fit your wants and needs, and can connect you to anything in the world."
5,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 Readers, Some of you might think people exercise computers. They don't act outside enough or interact with family or pets. You also @MONTH1 think that they are not getting enough exercise.Well you are right but I am going to explain way your wrong. You can do things like learn, socialize, and actually become healthy. The first thing you could do is learn. While you are on the internet you can go to learning websites. Some of those websites can teach you about faraway places like @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION2 and many more. You can also learn about people and their cultures. Take @CAPS3 @CAPS4 for example, you could learn their culture and the @CAPS5 they celebrate and why. Another thing you could do is take online classes if you are having trouble in school. Another thing you could do so the computer is socialize. You might think or say that when you are on the computer you cant socialize with family and friends. Well you can. There are websites like @CAPS6 and Facebook where all you do is talk to family and friends. Now you can web cam people. When you web cam you can see the person whom you are talking to you can hear them and they could hear you through a microphone on the web cam. Lastly you could go into chat rooms like @CAPS7 ( AOL instant message ) and talk to people while you are on that sight. The last thing you can do is become more healthy. Is it not surprising? yes, you can go onto websites that teach you day by day how to eat right and exercise. Websites like @PERSON1 esang.com car give you a might eating schedule right for your . After that website you could go out and get the you will need. Another thing that the computer offers is hand eye coordination. While you are looking at the screen your had is controlling the "" mouse"" while the, mouse controls where you go on the worldwide web. Lastly you will eventually want to go outside after visiting websites that show you moments and gardens of this world. So now hopefully you agree with me that computers do actually benefit some things in life. I have showed you what you can learn about, talk to people and socialize and lastly help you with your health. "
5,"Dear @CAPS1, Technology has made great improvements in the past years. Computers have now found a home in all most every business and home in @LOCATION1! Everyone thinks computers are so wonderful and can only positively affect you. But do they really consider both sides? Most likely not.. That is why I am here. Computers discourage exercise cut down the number @ORGANIZATION1 hours spent bonding with your family and are a waste @ORGANIZATION1 money and space. I believe computers should be reexamined and Pele should stop depending on them so much. Which country has more than @NUM1 million fast food, restaurants currently functioning? Name the fa test country in the world. Who spends the most on unhealthy food? The answer to all @ORGANIZATION1 those questions is the @LOCATION2. With over @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 the population being obese, something needs to be changed. According to studies done by the @ORGANIZATION1 (@CAPS2), @PERCENT2 @ORGANIZATION1 people spend over @NUM2 hours a day on the computer. @ORGANIZATION1 those @PERCENT2, @PERCENT3 are over weight or obese. There is an obvious pattern. Exercising makes your muscles stronger, improves lung function and helps burn off unnecessary calories. People most definitely need to get off the computer and exercise more. They might even like it. Spending time with your family can be great fun, as I recently discovered. Playing outdoors in team games brings out your competitive side, while board games challenge your mind. ""@CAPS3 who spend time with their family are @PERCENT4 more likely to do better in school,"" @CAPS4 @PERSON2 beyond. So what's stopping them?, Computers. Kids now find many internet sites online online more interesting than hanging out with family and friends. We need to turn @ORGANIZATION1 the computers, bring out the board games and keep @CAPS5 families together! ""In this economy, people cannot afford to waste money they don't have,"" @CAPS4 economist @PERSON1. And she is absolutely right! But what are @PERCENT5 @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS6 wasting money on? You guessed it; computers. The average bill per month is @MONEY2. In a whole year your paying @MONEY1 for something you don't need! Computers also waste space. Along with needing a place to house your monitor, you have to find room to cram a printer, the hard rive AND all those wires. Who can find enough room?! I certainly can't. Although technology, namely computers, can be a wonderful thing, we need to look at the downside. @CAPS6 continue to gain weight, families fall apart and the economy collapses, all because @ORGANIZATION1 computers. We need to stop the problems and turn off the computers."
5,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I have reason to believe that computers and other similar modern technologiesss is breaking up the world we once were. Things such as computers are a main cause of @CAPS3 lacking exercise, interaction with family and friends, and is also a possible danger to ones mental health. The leading cause of obesity and an outrageous amount of overweight people in @LOCATION1, is the fact that people spend way to much time on computers, and not exercising. I have recently found out that in the @DATE1's the average family had one computer (sometimes none). Nowadays, the average family has up to @NUM1, @NUM2, or even more! Furthermore, the percentage of obese peoples has sky rocketed since then, because people are almost always on the computer, rather than exercising like they should be. A major reason that modern technologiesss has hour t our nation, is that there is an immense lack of communication and interaction between families. Families are fighting/arguing more often, and spouses getting in divorces because they never get to spend time together. Studies have shown that nowadays @NUM3 of @NUM1 ma rages ends in a divorce, where as in @DATE2, it was @NUM3 of @NUM6. Advances in technologiesss have astoundingly increased since then, and people are on the computer/phones/other @CAPS4 which is separating families everywhere. When pubescent children are trying to grow and expand their minds, all they are doing is sitting on the computer, and not getting the brain nutrition they need. The students in schools today are the future leaders of the world. Now the paren'ts should be thinking, if they want their children to do well, or exceed their expectation in life, then they should not be sitting on the computer all day filling their heads with nonsense. Now, computers do have the ability to be educationally use full, but do children use them that way? The answer in no, and, ""@PERCENT1 of the time, neither do adults"", state @PERSON1 from the @ORGANIZATION1. I hope you can agree on the fact that computers are causing more bad than good in fa miles all around the world. People are not getting the amount of exercise they need, aren't interacting with family enough, and these computers can become harm full to the mental health of future generations. If families can minimize the amounts of computer drawn activities, then I think paren'ts all over the world can modify themselves about their children health."
5,"Dear @CAPS1, I be live that computers benefits the people of today. The invention of the computer had helped people to send messages and information to each other, helped students with school and allows children to have something to do when they can't go outside. Let me explain. The computer had created easier way for people to send messages and information to one and other. Before the invention of the computer, the only way to pass on information was by mail or phone. The computer sped up this process. In fact, people had received information about @PERCENT1 faster with the invention of the computer. I was once able to send my friend an email about getting the homework faster than writing him a letter. Clearly, computers made it easier for people to communicate with each other. Also, computers help students with school. Before the computer, a student had to use a type writer to type their papers. Using a typewriter, when they made mistakes which was on, they had to start all over. It;s a completely different story now. In fact, a study done by the board of ed. shows students write papers so faster and better with a computer rather than a typewriter. I remember my grandfather told me about how he typed papers. It took him about an hour he typed papers. It took him about an hour and a half to write a paper on a typewriter, while the longest it took him was a half an hour on a computer. As you can see computers have helped students all across the . Lastly, computers supply kids with things to do while they can't go out side to enjoy nature. Many people would that kids would go on their computer when they were able to go outside. A study done by the @CAPS2obesity shows that @PERCENT2 of kids would rather be outside playing and exercising than in their house on their computer. But sometimes, during certain weather conditions, kids aren't able to go outside, so they MT entertain themselves Indies. A study done by @ORGANIZATION1 shows that mere the @PERCENT3 of kids go on their computer when they can't be outside. If suddenly those kids lost their computer privileges, many of them will have little to entertain themselves with. Clearly, the computer occupies the time of kids who can't go outside. In conclusion, the computer has enormous benefits on society. It allows people to send messages and information faster, helps students with school, and gives kids something to do when they can't be outside. I hope that this letter had convinced you of the benefits of computers."
5,"To whom it @MONTH1 concern, The @NUM1's ware the beginning of a new age, computers had just come out and were mesmerizing people with its notelet. But now more and more people think its a waste of time. I for do want think this within these lives you will see my opinion take shape for the following reasons it's an information high lets artists expand their craft and engines are now able to plan buildings and bridges on their @CAPS1 to the internet student's and people are of knowledge each day the internet is essential to people writ ting an essay in fact the super internment of schools in @LOCATION1 has stated that over @PERCENT1 of students will use the internet to help them write an essay. We also don't have to go to the library any were to do research because we have a whole library of information at our house (the computer) another thing is that people are now able to communicate all over the world which will allow us to learn about other straight from the source. Artists are now able to do things were now a new art form of video games has out artists do you like to express yourself do! Music mixing has became my and it is over the will sometimes add additional and lapse other tracks it they don't have to use a typing machine any just jump on the computer type a keyboard. You can use spell check and edit undo instead of having to throw away idea that you didn't like. Artists have been by computers, And lastly are how able to plan out how a building or bridge might look, (which also with the video game making) @CAPS2 can make the house of their when you plan buildings and bridges on computer you can which makes them stronger, before you even start building them with the new soft ware available today how certain structural under natural disasters so they can pick the has the ability of becoming have way. I hope you can see using way eyes and agree that computers are they an amazing they that lets got information also help"
5,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you know that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students in @NUM3 grade go on the computer each night to complete homework and to connect with friends and family? I think the effects computers have on people are beneficial for everyone who uses one. A computer can be used for communication, education, and for accessing important information quickly, such as the local news. Now, let me tell you why computers are good for communication. When I was in elementary school, I had a friend who I was very close to and a part of his life. Unfortunately, he had to move away. But I still wanted to continue to be friends and communicate with him every once in a while. A convenient way to do this was by using a computer. The computer allows you to easily contact an old friend so that you can @CAPS5 stay in touch. Different types of communication on the computer can be email, instant messaging, video chat, online chat groups...etc. This helps people stay connected. That's why I think communication is the biggest effect on people due to the use of a computer. But, a computer can also be used for learning. At school or work, both kids and adults need access to the right information about research projects, vacation spots, learning about animals, food, cultures, and sometimes things as complicated as scientific chemicals. For example when my class researched different things about the @CAPS3 @CAPS4, our main source of information was the internet on our computers. We researched the customs, the foods, the way of dressing, the traditional holidays, and their way of entertainment. Also, kids come home from school and upload their essay and continue to type it. This is teaching them hand eye coordination, and how to type. The computer is not @CAPS5 used for just communication. It's a good way to educate everyone although the internet can be used to pass along important local and global information. ""@CAPS6 and adults often check their email and homepage everyday for the latest news on other countries, our country, the government, and the economy, ""says expert @PERSON1. I think that the internet gives citizens a fast and easy way to access information about what's going on in our town, state, country, and world. For example, it can tell us about the series of shootings gong on throughout @LOCATION1 or the many house robberies in our town. Us, @CAPS7 citizens, NWT to know everything... for us to stay safe and notified on the latest. Another example is that I logged on the computer three DAT's ago and it notified me about the earthquake in @LOCATION2. But there are so many benefits of a computer. The effects computers have on people are beneficial. It allows people to stay in touch, learn about places and people, and to stay up to date with the latest local and global news. I think you should take my ideas into consideration and publish them for everyone."
5,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, A recent survey said that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 doctors think the advances we have made with technology and computers is helping us rather than hurting us. I agree that computers are having a positive impact on us. Advances in technology are helping us become more officiant. Computers also give us the ability to research places and things we @MONTH1 never get the opportunity to see in person. We are also able to talk online with other people who we might have not met otherwise. The most important, though, is our advances in technology. Recently on the news I saw a segment of how at @ORGANIZATION2 they are using robots to make surgery more efficient. This also means that there are smaller incisions being made, so that means a faster recovery. Another part of society that has been advancing is crime solving. Before there were computers, there was no blood testing, no fingerprinting, and most likely no crays. Computers made these things much easier for people to accomplish. Computers are also useful for lending us the ability to research far away places or other topics that they @MONTH1 just have. Some people @MONTH1 never have the opportunity to go to places like @LOCATION4 or @LOCATION3, but with the computers it's almost like they have been there. Or maybe is in @CAPS1, but @CAPS1 isn't a very popular sport in @LOCATION2. And then they go on there computer and see that there is a rag by @LOCATION1. Then their problem is solved. When you go to a new country, you also get the opportunity to meet new people. But with computers and online sights like @CAPS2, @CAPS3 or you can talk to virtually anyone in the world. I could be sitting in a chair at my home in @LOCATION2, and be having a conversation with someone across the country, or maybe even across the ocean! Or possibly you could be talking to some of your really close friends who live just across town. Either way, the computer is a convenient place to go and talk to someone. I believe that computers are doing us more good than their harm. Our advances in technology have helped us immensely with things like games and robotic surgery. They also give us the ability to search topics we want to know more about or a faraway place we've never been to. Finally, we are able to talk online with people that @MONTH1 just be across town or across the ocean. I hope that my reasoning helps you understand my point of view."
5,"Dear local newspaper, I am sure you will agree with me about keeping the computers in this world. I am sure you will agree with me about keeping the computers in this world because computers help everyone in their education. For example when i don't understand some words i go to the computer type www.dictionary.com. Then i words that i don't understand. After that the definition comes up and in a faster time because when i look in the dictionary i take about @NUM1 to @NUM2 minutes to just find a word but on the computer it takes me @NUM3 seconds. Also computers let us chat and send massages when we can't see or take to a person so we send massages and the receive the message them they send back a message. Lastly computers help on English class like on spelling, writing, typing, editing & revising. That's why i think we should keep computers in this world. I know everyone doesn't know everything. Computers could help us in math, by using formulas and a calculator on calculator.com. Also computers help in science, by going to @LOCATION1 and asking questions like, ""what is matter or what are . Finally i am gonna talk about not understanding some words. I always go to dictionary.com so that website could give and help understand the word and get the real definition. I always use these @NUM2 websites when i am stuck in math or science or in English. Those websites could help a lot in our education. That's my way of thinking about the computers helping us in our education. My parents are always staked about me talking to my friends and hanging out with them. So, when i can see or talk to my friends i go MySpace or Facebook or Man to talk and send messages to my friends. We just keep charting and sending can messages because our parents don't let us hang out. Mostly everyone does the same. I do we could also send much other pictures, music and lot more. That's my opinion of why we should have commuters because we need to chat or send messages. At the end you know we all need to type our essays, lesson and more. The computers help use make power points they check our spelling, the could also change why we wright like cursive and more, they also help in editing & revising. I always keep sending words wrong. So the computer help me on spelling it also makes your project look better. That's why i think"
5,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, it has come to my attention that more and more people use computer, but not everyone agrees that this benefits the society. I strongly believe that computers do benefit society for three reasons. First, computers are a great source to do school work on. Computers let you learn more information. In addition, computers are a great way to keep in touch with friends and family. Clearly you can see why computers have positive effects on people and society. My first reason why I believe computers benefit society is because computers are a great source to use do school work with. An example of this would be if a science teacher gave their class an assignment to do that had to be typed. Its impossible to type an essay without a computer. Further more, if the project or assignment needs to have information looked up and their is no time in your day to go to a library, the computer is a great source. Now doesn't that make sense? Computers don't just help you with homework, but many people go to college online also. My parents don't have enough money to afford me to go to college, ""says @NUM1year old @PERSON1,"" so I take free course online and they work great! ""@CAPS1 it obvious that computers have a good effect on people? In addition to schoolwork, computers are a great place to look when you need information. For example, you have just bought a new house and want to know more about that area. The computer is an great place to look at updated pictures, and learn about your new hometown. Sixtynine percent of people use information from the computer to buy a home. People @MONTH1 also want to learn basic information about bears or bees is my belief that the computer is a great source to do learn information obviously, computers have a great effect on people and it benefit society. Lastly, computers are helpful ways to keep in touch with family and friends. ""I have my whole mom's side of the family living in @LOCATION1. When I get to use the computer to keep in touch with them. I feel closer and part to keep in touch with them. i feel closer and part of one big happy family,"" @PERSON2 of @STATE1, @NUM2, says. People who have family living in other states, countries and even other countries, don't get to see each other every day of the year @CAPS2 is why computers can help, the people keep in touch. Another example would be if your mom or dad went away for a few days, weeks or months and you wanted to talk to them of ten. A good way to do that would be using email or instant messaging. Therefore, i strongly believe that computers are great for people and do benefit the society. to sum it all up, computers benefits society and have positive effects on people. Computers are great sources to do school work, they give you information your looking for, and are great ways to keep in touch with family and friends. Clearly you can see why I strongly believe that computers have a strong and positive effect on people and benefit the society. Thank you!"
5,"A large amount of people use computers daily, but not everyone agrees this technology benefits society. I think that computers benefit our way of life in many ways. This very useful technology has a positive effect on people because, it allows people to send, receive, and research a vast variety of information easily. @PERCENT1 of people use the computer to get information and get it more quickly than reading a book about that specific topic. They say that this powerful technology has been more effective and quicker. My cousin and I were both given the same research paper to do. He used several books to get information on the topic and I used the computer. The project took me @NUM1 days to do, while it took him a whole week to complete. @PERSON1, computer programming expert, said, ""Computers have made receiving information so much faster. I vehemently believe that everyone should own this device. Moreover, computers help with communication. There are many ways to keep in touch with people over the world, like email, chat rooms, and websites like @CAPS1 and @CAPS2. These websites are a great tool to keep in touch with family and friends or even fans. @PERSON2, lead singer of the band @CAPS3 @ORGANIZATION1, said ""@CAPS1 is a way to talk to the fans directly ad post updates about upcoming tours and albums. Not only is it great for bands but it is great for college students. My older brother is a college student and we communicate through these websites so it seems like he is never that far away. The computer can also help with business. Meeting can be done through @ORGANIZATION2 or a different web chat service. Emails are a great way to send information. @NUM2 of business meetings are held over the internet has benefited work ethics. Please heed my advice and use the internet and computer. It will benefit your way of communication and your way of getting information."
5,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 people think that computers educate people for the future but I think that they actually harm children and adults as well. First of all, kids are so wrap ed up in computer games that they never go out and exercise. Second, if you ask a child anything about nature they will probably not know what to say, but they would if they spent less time on the computer. Finally, many families today never see each other because kids and their parents are too busy on the computer. These three reasons show why computers don't benefit society. Obesity is a huge problem among the children in @LOCATION1. The reason for this is that they are spending too much time online and not outdoors and exercising. Kids are not getting any fresh air or exercise and this can lead to serious health conditions. Parents sometimes don't do anything about it because they they have the same problem. This just shows that computers and other technology are effecting families around the country by making them overweight and. @CAPS1 children don't know the first thing about nature and. People say that computers educate people about things but nature and the environments is a big of our lives. The best learn about it and help. Computers the time they are, the earth might become even worse so they need to get educated on nature and the environment so they can. I know from my own experience that computers tacke away time from your friends and family. Instead of playing games on the computer at home, you could be spending time with your family in the park or the pool. My dad always spend his time on the computer and we never had time to spend with him. When he realized this he rearranged his schedule so we could have more time together. It is very important to spend time with your family because they are such a big part of your life and less of computer will help families do that. As you can see, getting off the computer will help kids stay in shape and healthy, educate them on the environment, and help families interact with each other more. If getting off the computer changed my families lifestyle then it will do the same to others as well. Hopefully you agree with me because it will surely tack a positive affect. "
5,"Click click, another information page opens up on your handy @LOCATION4 these trusty, smart, and easy to use div ices are always a object to have. Although, people are now starting that these handy desktops are bad for your well being opposing that people strongly think that we dint get enough exercise or outdoor activity's in. Well computers are such a great entertainment system also, have a vast information supp lie, and even allow socialization with friends/ family. I don't understand why they say this. So let me express my love for computers to you. Televisions, radios, and @NUM1 payers are no match for the internet and it's great wide spread entertainment system. The computer has all of the family fun movies, iTunes tracks, and even websites where you could make your own movies. Posting pictures on the @CAPS1 and sending them via email only by a click of your mouse. The internet is the obvious best reason for a family movie night. One of the greatest pro about the internet is the vividest of information. Google, Wikipedia, or even dictionary.com are the greatest information sites of the @DATE1. As much as nature watching and exercise is healthy and fun I would rather learn about a sunny beach of @CAPS2 or the great landscape of @LOCATION1. If your looking up how to tie a tie or even info about your history report the @CAPS3 is a sure easy thing. How could you talk to your friend who is across the world in @LOCATION2 or Germany. The answer is simple, Skype, Facebook, MySpace and more are all available on your handy @CAPS3. Many sites have a no fee policy so they cant charge them money for social living with friends. As a personal experience I could now talk to my cousins WHO live in @LOCATION3 and @LOCATION1 due to the great interaction site of Facebook. And why would you take the time to run across town to be unsure that their even there. Obviously internet is a great socializing activity. Now that I have stated my opinion about the wonderful effect of the internet such as the entertainment system, information about the history of the world, and even the socializing with friends. I'm people will open their eyes see the great uses of the computer."
5,"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1's small world after all  and growing smaller as computer usage becomes more and more widespread. Thousands upon thousands of sites and applications are now at your fingertips. I firmly believe that the effects of computers are overwhelming positive. For one thing, they increase hand eye coordination.For another, they are a great means of communication.Finally they are a very powerful research tool. Some @MONTH1 say that computers are lessening time with family and friends, but I don't agree. Computers help us stay more connected than ever! The computer is not evil  quite the opposite! First of all, computers are great for increasing hand eye coordination. In recent study by @PERSON1, he noticed a significant increase in motor skills of children aged @NUM1 to @NUM2 when they used educational computer programs souch as @CAPS2 @CAPS3 for just half an hour, once a day. Children who did not use the program were seen to develop motor skills at a mouch lower rate. Handeye coordination is a skill needed from birth to death, and should be encouraged as ouch as possible. I know that @CAPS1 greatly helps me in my daily life  and probably you in yours as well  from the mos basic tasks of eating and brushing my teeth to typing, drawing, and playing piano. As you can see, hand eye coordination is very important. Second in my reasoning is that computers are brilliant communication aids. People can't always be reached by phone. An email could be waiting for them online whenever  and where ever  they check @CAPS1. Also, documents can be sent over email that would be near impossible for a home phone and difficult for most cells to process. Revolutionary videoconferencing programs like @ORGANIZATION2 can even allow us to talk to people around the world, practically eye to eye. I use @CAPS1 to keep in toouch with family on the @LOCATION2. How about you? Last  but (at the risk of sounding cliched) definitely not the least  computers are very powerful research tools. Everything from the schedule of the local zoo (thus preventing toddler meltdowns when one arrives only to find @CAPS1 closed) to the average life span of the @CAPS4 elephant (@NUM3 years). Rather than skimming book after books for a single piece of information, plug your query into any of many search engines, from @ORGANIZATION1 to @CAPS5., and find answers instantly. Find about @LOCATION3 without the expense of a plane ticket. See photos of @LOCATION1  a sight most people would never get to see without the internet. The computer can take us anywhere. In conclusion, computers are a great resource that are often wrongly portrayed in a bad light. Computers teach and improve valuable hand eye coordination. Also, they help greatly with communication. And finally, they are a powerful research device. Computers are of tern shown as the bane of society. This is simply untrue. They are an excellent tool for all ages. Technology is not our enemy. Don't treat @CAPS1 like one."
5,"How would you like to got a ""@CAPS1"" on your social studies report? What if you couldn't see your school friends at all after school? What if you were bored to death, and you couldn't watch t.v. or play games? Some experts are about people because they think they are spending too much time using their computers and not enough time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. On your computer: you can watch videos and play games, you can chat and talk to people, and you can even boost up your grade. I honestly think that the thought of people being on their computers too much is a silly thought @CAPS2, let's look at how a computer can change your life. Lets say you have a history report the tomorrow, you forgot your history book at school, and you know nothing about the report. You are going to fail if you don't hand it in, so why not turn on your computer and open up the internet browser. I remember @TIME1 year I was doing a report about the @CAPS4 @CAPS3. I literally knew nothing about them and I failed to bring home my book. I opened up the internet and typed in @CAPS4 @CAPS3 in @ORGANIZATION1 and @DATE1 I found out that I got a @NUM1 on the report. You can also use the computer just to look up information for for about something that you might learn in school. ""@TIME1 @DATE1, I was reading about the @CAPS6 @CAPS7 and a few days @DATE1 we talked about how that @CAPS7 possibly could have been made. I was the only student in our grade that knew that answer. You can use the computer for playing games that are related to school. For example, how fast can you complete all of these multiplication problems or division problems. Look at what computers can do. If you got bad grades (without computer), you will go to a bad college and have a bad job, however, if you got good grades(with computer), you will go to a good college and get a good job. Next, let's look at how you can chat or talk to people. You can have a mes aging connection with someone by using @CAPS8 or a free to free conversation using @ORGANIZATION2 on your computer. Studies show that @PERCENT1 of people with computers have either @CAPS8 or @ORGANIZATION2 installed in their computers. You can also communicate with people who has an email address. I remember having a problem with my laptop and my crush knows everything about them. So I emailed him and how I get a response and I fixed my laptop. You are able to interact with people by meeting them online and then them on public. Everyone know about those dating websites that matches two people and them together. A computer can really the of your life. Lastly, let's look at what you can do in the computer when you are bored. Why you go YouTube and watch videos that look appropriate and interesting? ""@CAPS10, I was done with homework and I didn't know what to do, so i online and spend only watching YouTube videos, sometimes people like playing games. Just @TIME1, I was playing tetras, but only for @NUM2 minutes because I needed a goodnight's before the @CAPS11. You can also listen to the radio on a website. Statistics show that @PERCENT2 of people that listened to the radio @CAPS10 were in cars. But @PERCENT3 is also @PERCENT4 more listening to the radio online. Not only can a computer increase your grades and improve your life, can entertain you as well. As you can see, saving the of computers is is a silly idea and is absolutely nonsense. Computers can and make you. I honestly never seen someone on the computer for."
5,"I have realized that there as been a disagreement about computers the positive and negative effects on people. It seems to me, in my opinion that computers have more of a negative affect on people than positive. I believe tat people are spending too much time on the computer and not exercising, they don't spend quality time with family & friends and need to get fresh air and enjoy nature. Although computers are a great piece of technology, many don't get outside to enjoy the nature & fresh air because their computers are inside their homes. This is not good because when you go outside, it helps skin health from the sunlight & lets in fresh air for your lungs. In addition, a walk outside to enjoy nature wouldn't hurt either. It can relieve stress & can be relaxing. Furthermore, it is obvious when people are on the computer, they usually block out what their friends & family are saying to them. People can lose track of time & be on the computer for hours. Instead you should use this time to be with your friends and family. Being with your family can make your bond between each other stronger and you can get along with each other better. Also, having a nice family time is a good way to help be with your family. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 experts say that eating a family dinner can help a child's grades & prevent them from using drugs or dropout of high school or college. Finally, kids are more obese than us because they don't get enough excessive. At least @PERCENT1 or more kids are obese from recent studies. Due to this; this can lead to bone & joint issues, heart disease, lung problems, diabetes and asthma. These issues above are serious health problems if not treated. If kids exercises instead of being on a computer all day, the number of obese kids will drop drastically. Excersize can help kids' self esteem, and get them back in shape. They can either play sports or even take a walk or run. There are many different things you can do to excessive and its fun for kids. Unquestionably, there is definitely more reasons why there is a negative affect on kids/adults due to computers for the reasons above and more. Computers prevent people from enjoying nature to get fresh air. Likewise, they also prevent families & friends to spend time with each other and lastly, it isn't allowing kids to excessive which can lead to obesity."

5,"Almost everyone in the @LOCATION1 uses a computers at one point in their life. Computers are a way to teach hand eye coordination through programs, games and typing. The internet can be used for researching different far away cultures, as well as someone's own lifestyle. This compact well made piece of technology has been be laming more and more intricate. Realizing how much help computers have in everyday life, people will be the down fall or support for computer technology moving forward. One very basic but evident result from using a computer is hand eye coordination. Since the time children are in grade school, they learn typing on a keyboard. Special programs help kids learn the necessary skill while enjoying the practice. When I was small, a mere fight years old, I remember typing. I was always excited when my mom and I went to Barnes and noble to pick up a new typing program. I especially enjoyed ""type to learn"" and @CAPS1 typing lessons as well as teaching children to type is general, teaches hand eye coordination in high school, college, and the job world. Young adults and adults are expected to type papers, resumes, and applications. In this day in age the technology era has begin and typing is a necessity. Another way to teach hand eye coordination is through computer games. A simple challenge like solitaire, bejeweled or car racing teach the skill and much more advanced games for example, world of war craft need perfect coordination can be through typing and games, both on the computer. Though some experts are concerned ""people are spending too much time on the computer and less time..enjoying nature,"" you are able to learn about geography, travel, and nature. One amazing on a computer is the world wide web. This consists of millions of websites, pages, search engines, and information Artie you in an upcoming geography uses? Are you planning a trip the for you do you need to find a definition for the word ""cognitive""? of @CAPS1 pertain to you, a legitimate website house your and all you need to do is search. Instead of having to travel to learn about special wonders, for travel prices are expensive and you can simply, click and type to and amazing at your searching on a computer, you can learn about long ago cultures and rituals. Information you would find at museum @NUM1 years ago. @CAPS1 complex simple to use technological a world of pictures simple, art and history right at your fingertips."
5,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 you like a place where you can control what you @CAPS1 and where you go? I know I @CAPS1. Well, if you afire with me then the computer is your cup of tea I think that computers have a positive effect on society. I think this for @NUM1 main reasons @CAPS2 with others, getting constant updates on whats going on, and a learning tool make up only some of the fascinating aspects the computer has. So read on I know you will think the same way as me about computers given my knowledge below. The computer captures over @NUM2 million humans attention with online social networks Facebook, MySpace, and @CAPS3 are the main attractions. In all of these websites you can keep up with whats going on with your friends and whats new around the world. These online social networks connect you and the people in your life to a crazy online adventure. All these websites provide the information that people want and keep nth em logging back on everyday. I think these websites are great and can only improve society. This is my first benefit of a computer. Another way aspect that the computer provides is world news and big events and drama that is happening in our society. Many news channels have their own websites and update what happened on their show. They provide pictures, stories, and actual videos of whats happening right now. The computer helps us Americans know what is happening in @LOCATION1 and lets @LOCATION1 know whats happening in the @LOCATION1 and the @CAPS4.S arn't the only ones trough The computers provides international news and gossip for everyone. Here is another reason why the computer is great for society. There are many things that us kids don't know and if we need some deep information we search it on the computer. The computer provides websites giving information on every time you could think of. For example, if I were to be stuck on some science homework I could probably type in my question on ask.com and get a great answer. Parents and teachers want their kids to sauced and the computer definitely helps. In conclusion, I have given you @NUM1 great, well thought out reasons why the computer benefits society. @CAPS2 with others, updates worldwide and information on school all are in a great piece of technology called the computer. I hope you will trust me that the computer has a positive effect on society."

5,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I believe that computers do benefit society in a positive way. Without computers we would not be able to be as social. We also would not have the ability to do res each for school online and running a business would be even more difficult. Without computers our society would not be so far advanced. Being social is an important quality in life. the main way of being social these days, other than testing, is to chat online with friends. Facebook, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and Skype all give their users the ability to make new friends, find long lost friends, and chat with friends. I personally have a Skype and Facebook, and I am able to access them everyday. Without them, I wouldn't be able to chat with friends out of school except for sports and testing. Everyday I workout and lift weights and go on Facebook, that is why that whole statement, ""spending less time exercising, and more time on the computer"" is false. Facebook and Skype are a past of my everyday life and without them I know I would not be as social. Computers are also a part of my everyday life, because I have to use it to do research for school or typing up an @CAPS5 paper. As you have now seen, my handwriting is not so great, so I end up typing a lot of my homework because of it. Without computers my teachers would not be able to read my work. Computers also help with making graphs and data tables for science lab reports. Without a computer the graphs would have to be handmade, which is not as presentable. Overall computers are used everyday in school to either do research or to type up some homework. Education plays a key role in society and if we did not use computers out education that we would receive would not be the same as it is now. My last reason why i believe that computers play a positive role in society is that computers are what keeps businesses running. Without computers some businesses would be unable to function, and those could function, would be awful slow. Since our society is so far advanced our businesses need computers in order to complete the jobs. Expenses and income are saved to businesses computers, if that was all done an paper they could be lost or ruined. Computers also simplify work for businesses, they speed up the tasks that would takes a long time to be hand done and they complete the tasks that could not be achieved without a computer. Computers play a large part in the @CAPS6 of the world."
5,"Dear editor, Computers are one of the best things that have ever happened to the human race. They benefit society in every way imaginable, and have numerous positive affects on people. Computers improve hand eye coordination, allow people to learn about many subjects that books do not give them aces to, and allow millions of people every day to talk and communicate with friends and family. The most important use for computers is learning. Using computers, billions of people gain knowledge that they never would have been able to learn before. Many people like myself check the weather on the computer daily, making sure we are prepared or dressed appropriately for the weather. Without computers, I would not be able to do this. Also, on days when it snows during the night, I always check the school's website when I wake up in order to ensure that school is still on. This is a helpful resource and I don't know what I'd do without it. Another thing computers allow us to do is check the news. With the click of your mouse, you can check to see who won the presidency, or what shows are on tonight. Another amazing aspect of computers is that they improve eye hand coordination greatly. This not only benefits my mom who checks her email five times every minute, but my little three year old sister who loves to move the mouse around, and type in random letters on documents. It could entertain her for days, but most importantly, it helps improve her eye hand coordination every second she sits in that chair. This improved skill will help her enormously in her future when she soon begins to play sports, and ride bikes. Finally, computers allow millions of friends and family to communicate daily at no cost. If classmates forgot to write down homework they can email the teacher instantly, and know exactly what the homework is and even open the sheet that the teacher attached, and print it out. A couple of weeks ago, my dad went to @LOCATION1 for thirteen days, and it was outrageously expensive to talk to him on his phone. So, every couple days, he video chatted with me instead so I could talk to him. hear what he was doing, and even see the view of @LOCATION2 from his window. This was very special to me and could not have been done without computers. As it is so plainly clear, computers help us in so many ways that we forget about like educating us, improving our eye hand coordination, and allowing us to communicate with friends and family. These are just a couple of the positive affects and benefits that computers provide us with."
5,"Dear @PERSON2, @CAPS1 your latest article on the goods and bad's of computers in our society was informative, I believe you left out a few major reasons why technology is doing more harm than good. If people don't become aware of the consequences, who knows where our world is heading? First off, I'd like to mention the health issues associated with technology in general, but especially computers. Dr. @PERSON1 of @ORGANIZATION2 states that ""@CAPS2 since the popularity of the internet boomed with the invention of websites like '@CAPS3' and '@CAPS4', we've seen a drastic spike in obesity related heart disease and diabetes."" And @PERSON3 isn't exaggerating. Because of the sudden boom in electronics, more and more people prefer sitting on the couch with their brand new laptop or @CAPS5 then go for a bike ride or play a game of fastball with friends. Because of this, more and more people become victims of heart attacks, strokes, cancer, and bone ellipses that could leave them paralyzed for the rest of their life. Is playing that online game so important, to you that its worth your life? Next, I'd like to touch on the fact that @CAPS1 the internet @MONTH1 seem like a great place to do some socializing, it can actually aid in losing friends ins ted of making them. I know what your thinking, @PERSON2, 'But sites like '@CAPS6' help people connect, why would they lose friends?' @CAPS7, really. Since its so easy to type in a conversation, people are losing actual social skills. They also spend too much time talking to friends without meeting facets, and that eventually causes them to drift apart. And when talking to someone over a screen, its so hard to know if your actually close friends. Because of this, they cant bond and they wont have a real friendship. @PERSON4, a @NUM1 year old at @ORGANIZATION1, says that him and his best friend now only talk over @CAPS3, and they dint even feel like true friends anymore. So finally, I have a request. Next time you turn on that laptop, think. Is this really worth losing your friends and even your health @CAPS2? Next time feel the urge to update your status with something like '@CAPS8 got home,' @CAPS8 call a friend over to go hang out at the park instead. Trust me, you'll be glad you did. Thank you for the time to read my letter."
5,"Dear local newspaper, I believe that with too much use of computer it will have bad affects on people. People can get addicted to it so easily. They also use a lot of electricity. And people sit on the computer all day and don't exercise at all. These are all bad affects computers have, but their not all bad, without them life might be a little harder. Playing computer games, and online poker sounds fun right? Wrong! People get addicted to them everyday. Online poker could be dangerous. I remember seeing a show about this guy who was addicted to it. He'd put his credit card information in and sit and play all day. Before he knew it, he was in debt. Once he was addicted it was very hard for him to stop. It's a stupid thing to get into because there is no point to it. You sit and waste money, especially with our economy the way it is. A recent study shows that @PERCENT1 of people who play online poker are addicted within two weeks. Other games are also addicting too. There's a website that called addicting. I guess people don't know the affects of being addicted to a computer has on them and their family. Did you know that @PERCENT2 of electricity in @LOCATION1 goes to computer? Thats almost half of it going to one thing. I don't think it's right that pretty much everything is done on the computer now. In our economic crisis I don't think Emery should be wasted playing computer games. We could use energy for more important things that people any need. If everyone didn't need computers to communicate and everything there wouldn't be a problem. The number of computers sold has gone up @PERCENT3 since @DATE1. I understand emailing, and Facebook. But don't get out of hand with it. Isnt being outside on a beautiful day great? Wouldn't you rather enjoy that or exercises rather than sitting glued to a computer? Obesity is a huge problem in @LOCATION1. A lot of people are obese from sitting on the computer and not exercising. I remember when I was younger, every time I went to my friends house, his dad would be sitting and playing poker and games on the computer. He was very out of shape and lazy. His parents later got a divorce because he turned into a totally different person. Most @CAPS1 are lazy. We don't like to do work if we don't have to. I would define they rather excesses or go outside instead of being on the computer. You live a lot healthier when you're not addicted to the computer. And when you're healthier, you're happier. So in conclusion, if you don't control yourself on the computer it can have bad affects. Computers are easy to get addicted to, use a lot of electricity, and can make people fat and lazy. Do you think playing computer games is worth losing friends and family?"
5,"Dear newspaper editor: @CAPS1 are all living in the age of technology. There are many useful devices that help us live our every day lives. The computer is a major help. @CAPS1 can talk with relatives from different areas and you can surf the internet to learn new information. @CAPS4 you can playing games with people from ground the world. The computer is a great div ice. Almost everyone has a relative that lives in anothee state or country. Well you never see them because they live far away right? With a computer you can talk and even have a face to face conversation with them. @CAPS2 can bring your family closer togethee. For example, my family just got a new computer and @CAPS1 have relatives that live in Florida that @CAPS1 almost never see. With the computer my dad talks to them almost everyday. Some people that I have talked to said that thee are excited to see their relatives or friends more often. @CAPS2 has brought them closer togethee and made them better friends. The internet is a wonder place where you can look up information for a school project and learn about different topics. When kids are doing a project in school and the information they need is not in the class book they can search @CAPS2 and @CAPS2 saves time. @PERCENT1 of kids said that when they are doing a project the best thing to use would be the internet. @CAPS4 @CAPS2 helps the kids work faster so they can spend more time outside or hanging out with their friends. Anothee thing you can do is learn about recent events. For example most local newspaper have a website that you can visit. Even if you local does not you can go to othee websites like ""@CAPS3"". They have recent events that happen around the country and around the world. The internet is useful in many ways and can help you with your every day life. Every kid gets bored when its a rainy day. So they can play games with people from around the world using a computer. The are many websites that have fun games that are fun and enjoyable. You can @CAPS4 become with people from othee country's. My friends @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 play the computer and they have alto of friends from othee country's. I think that its cool that you are playing the exact game with anothee. Person in @LOCATION1 or @LOCATION2, @CAPS4 most of the games are safe and fun to play. Anothee thing is that you can connect and play with your friends in your home town. I have many times pl ayes games with @PERSON1 and @PERSON2. @CAPS2's a fun thing to do during a boring, rainy day. In conclusion, the computer is a useful div ice that's benefits us and helps us with our everyday life. @CAPS2 allows us to connect with family in far away places and surf the internet for new information. @CAPS4 you can play games with people from around the world. Its a wonderful div ice and lets start using @CAPS2. "
5,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, Computers are a helpful advantage in the @CAPS4's life. It offers and contributes many ideas and actions. Computers help people find a nice spot to travel. Also it helps people meet or make @CAPS1 friends. A computer is another way for people to get their hand eye coordination better. Computers are very help full in a humans life. Computers are use full when trying to explore @CAPS1 places. One can book a flight anywhere in a matter of mi nits on a computer. How else would it be possible to travel someplace far away without booking a flight on a computer. Next, computers help learn about different clotures. Once one has booked reservations to a certain travel spot on their computer, they will learn much about the unfamiliar land they have went to. My family has gone to many different areas around the world. The trips would not have been possible without help researching and making flights with the computers. The computer makes it possible to experience to territory's. It is a key item when someone is looking to travel. A computer is immensely important when trying to communicate with friends. People can meet and make friends very simply using websites such as Facebook on the computer. Facebook creates friendship very easily. I recently waited to get to know a students better. I looked him up on Facebook and now we are agencies. Next, programs on the computers such as A.I.M. help people communicate about anything such as homework to other personal topics. Lastly, if one wants to get to know another better he or she can look at their blog. They @MONTH1 start to talk and become good friends. Computers are us full when trying to communicate or find friends. Computers not only help with travel and friends but it also helps with ones hand eye coordination. Typing letters while looking at a screen is using the hand eye coordination. This action can help with sports. For example in baseball one must have a good hand eye coordination to help catch and hit the ball. Secondly, with hand eye coordination getting better with the computer. it helps kids fit in. If one has good hand eye coordination they can play sports are make friends. If one becomes good with hand eye coordination and typing they will be able to get a job writing for a newspaper or a book. Hand eye coordination and typing with computers can lead to a successfully life. Computers in an @CAPS5 life can help in the long run. It will help with travel plans, friends, and hand eye coordination."
5,"Dear editor of the @PERSON1, I heard you are writing a section in your newspaper about computers and I just thought I would voice my opinion. Personally, I think computers have a positive effect on people. First, I think computers are swell because you are able to learn things about faraway places, like countries on the other side of the world, from the comfort of your home. Also, the information on the internet can help with students' school works. Finally, you are able to talk with other people online. These are just a few points why computers are very impotent, that you should include in your article. First off, editor of the @PERSON1, I think computers are good for mankind because you are able to learn about places on the other side of the world, while sitting at home drinking hot cocoa. This is so very convenient. There are websites containing the geography, languages, and traditions of countries waiting for you to learn. For example, once my friend, @PERSON3, was planning on going to @LOCATION1 for a business trip, but had no idea how to speak the language. I recommended the website, www.Indianow.com and in two weeks she was speaking like an expert. Another time, my sister, @PERSON4, was visiting her in laws for the first time. They were full @CAPS1 and she wanted to bake something traditional for them. She looked up a recipe on the web and everyone was satisfied with the scrumptious ravioli she made. This is just one reason the internet is so useful. Second, computers are an amazing invention because you can find help for schoolwork easily. My brother, @PERSON5, was having problems with learning about the seasons, but with one click, he was full of knowledge. Also, nowadays they even have online tutors and online colleges! Professor @PERSON2 states that @PERCENT1 of passing college students are earning their degree online. This is a fabulous point on why computers are so important. Lastly, computers are really significant to society because you are able to talk with other people online. With video chat, chat rooms, Facebook and @CAPS2, you are bound to make a friend who would last a lifetime. I know I did! There are even online dating sites and matchmakers. For instance, after mu uncle divorced my aunt, she was devastated and couldn't date again for the longest time. I told her to try one of those online dating sites, she took my advice and found a lovely man. They have been dating for @NUM1 months. Last @DATE1 he proposed. They are now happily engaged. This is my last reason how computers can change someone's life in a positive way. In conclusion, I think computers are a fantastic invention because you are able to learn about faraway places while staying at home. receive help with your schoolwork, and talk with other people online. I really hope you will consider my opinion for your article, editor of the @ORGANIZATION1. Thank you for your time."
5,"Dear @PERSON1, To this day, there are many people who use telecommunication devices, like the computer. Some think computers have a positive effect on people. Others are concerned that people spend too much time on them. I think that both these opinions are correct. Although using a computer can become an addicting and unhealthy habit, they teach a person everyday about something, are enjoyable, and help save the earth. Using computers is something I know millions of people use everyday, and would think @CAPS2 would be difficult to live without. For example, my family owns four computers. We each have our own specific reasons for using them. For my mom, @CAPS2's usually working or checking her emails. For me and my sister, @CAPS2's researching and typing of homework, and communicating with our friends via Facebook or. So say when my mom is working, or me and my sister are researching something we learn. Before these were computers, everyone used, but now that we have the internet, threes no really need to get a book. Most of the time people wont even have the book their looking either have to go out and buy get one from the library. Now this is an inconvenience to people, so why not use the internet that's quick, and. People also use computers to like I mentioned above with maybe Facebook, @CAPS1, or email.@CAPS2's quick, easy and fun. @CAPS2 also saves paper which helps the planet. We always use to send letters, but now with these sources, you don't need to much! Computers are also fun for kids because you can play a lot of games on bring. Now even though I mentioned all those good things, there are unfortunately bad ones too. So many people use computers everyday, and @CAPS2's bad for your physical and mental health. People spend so much time on them that they can get easily addicted. This means they will be on them all the time, and never do other things like go outside. They wasn't exercise which could be bad for their physical health. Also, staring at a screen all day is bad for your eyes, and brain. So I think, due to these causes, people shouldn't use them constantly. In conclusion, I'd like to say that people should use computers for learning things, go outside or do something active because spending all this time on computers can result in physical and mental health issues. Thank you and I hope you agree with my statements."
5,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS4 many people think computers are bad there are many reasons as to why they are good. Computers are very environmental friendly and so are @PERCENT1 @DATE1 people today. They also allow us to type assignments and other important papers. People also don't know that they are not the worst @ORGANIZATION1 on the market today. Computers @MONTH1 take away time from people that they should be spending on excessive, but computers aren't the only thing that do that more people spend time watching @CAPS5 then they do on any other activity, @PERSON2 head @DATE1 @ORGANIZATION1 conducted a survey in @DATE1. His survey showed that out @DATE1 the @NUM1 people questioned @PERCENT2 spent @NUM2 hours a day watching @CAPS5, @PERCENT3 spent @NUM3 hours on the computer, @PERCENT4 spent @NUM4 hours reading and @PERCENT5 spent @NUM4 hours exercising. So clearly computers are not our biggest problem. Many people today are ""@CAPS7"" or ""@CAPS8environment"". So instead @DATE1 buying newspapers or magazines most people go online to research current events. @PERSON1, @CAPS9 @DATE1 the @ORGANIZATION2. Says if we use computers instead @DATE1 newspapers @PERCENT6 @DATE1 the trees we cut down each year will be save. So obviously computers are environment friendly. Todays youth is messier than it ever was. @CAPS10 are having a hard time grading papers and tests because @DATE1 kids hand writ ting. So instead @DATE1 handwrit ting papers, kids make it easier on @CAPS10 by typing their work. Rescent studies show that @PERCENT7 @DATE1 @CAPS10 find it easier + better for kids to type papers. This shows kids are better off typing papers, and assignments. I hope you now understand my position on computers. The help us in many other ways too. In conclusion, they are not as time consuming as every one @MONTH1 think. They also help us with research, are enviromentalfriendly, and help the youth @DATE1 our world become neater one click at a time."
5,"Do you remember school projects sitting down bored and watching your @CAPS1 stations or sitting in the doctors office waiting bored out of your mind? Well no more! Since the computer was invented there have been many many advancements and all of those things are gone. There was once a time when the only way to do a project on a country was to look in the paper until you found something now with computer advancements you can enter a country's came into Google, a search site, and up comes @NUM1 things on that country. In fact @PERSON1 a expert on computers and inventor of one of the most advanced computers on earth says that searching for information is now @PERCENT1 to @PERCENT2 easier depending on the topic. Also you no longer have to work a redundant type write that always makes mistakes that you have to retype. You can just use @ORGANIZATION1 and you type your essay. Anything spelled wrong is underlined in red so you only rarely have a spelling mistake. As a result of this increase in knowledge, from a learning stand point computers are extremely good for mankind. My second reason that computers are extremely good for us is that they are entertaining. On your new laptop you can go on mini clip or addicting games, both gaming websites and play games. These game while not only are fun improve hand eye coordination which helps with sports, driving, writers and many other things. More advanced gaming computers called consoles such as the @CAPS2box @NUM2, by @ORGANIZATION1, the @NUM3, the @CAPS3 by the @CAPS4 provide extreme gaming experience. One of the more recent games for these consoles is called @CAPS5 of @CAPS6! Modern @CAPS7 @NUM4. This game has an online system where you can talk to and play against people all around the world. Not only that but advanced games such as @CAPS5 of @CAPS6 improve eyesight. Studies show that playing a high action game @NUM4 hrs a day will improve eyesight more than eating @NUM6 serving carrots a day. My final reason that computers are good for you is that they take boring waits. If you've everyone to @CAPS10 you know that the lime can be @NUM4 hrs long. People used to wait that just standing there. Now people can pull out their @CAPS11 or @NUM8 player and listen to music. The @CAPS11 can take videos and pictures as well as play music, videos and games. If you are lucky enough to have an I touch you can check email, stocks, weather and news right on your @CAPS13 as well as buy songs which can be @NUM9 cheaper than @CAPS14. In conclusion all of this advantage in technology benefits us greatly. We can now learn about new exiting things have fun while improving eyesight and we don't have to wait."
5,"I People spend too much time on the computer. A lot of people are on the computer for about the whole day. They should be spending time with family and friends. People never have enough time for activities. Also computer should mostly be used for talking with family and friends, homework,research, games @CAPS1 bored, and work. To begin with, people need to spend more time with family and friends rather than on the computer. For example @CAPS1 your mother or father asked you @CAPS1 you wanted to go out to dinner and you said no, I'm on the computer, that would just mean your obsessed with going on the computer. A lot of families are being broken apart because people spend too much time on the computer @CAPS1 you have a friend over and they say I am bored and all you are doing is play games on the computer than that is just being rude because your friend is bored. So you need to get off the computer and spend time with your loved ones. Previously I stated how people spend time with loved ones, well people need to spend more time doing activities as well. A lot of humans sit on the computer and eat so over the time they eventually get fat. @CAPS1 you are gaining weight because your on the computer than you need to go do some activate to off that fat. @CAPS1 you are a teen and you are given the idea to play a sport and you it because computer is more important then is some serious obsession with the computer. As a result, the computer should be used wisely. The computer should be used to talk to family and friends, homework, research, work, and @CAPS1 you bored play some games little games on the computer. Those are probably the most important things that should most likely used for the computer. A lot of these things that I have listed are important because @CAPS1 you go on the computer just to be on and watch people talk then what's the point of wasting your time on the computer when you could be doing much more different things on the computer. For example, @CAPS1 you have homework such as vocabulary and you need definitions you can go to www.dictionary.com to find them, or @CAPS1 you just need to define a simple word. In conclusion, people spend too much time on the computer. They need to be spending more time with family and friends. Also people need to be doing more activities in their lives. Lastly, you should use the computer for useful things like homework or even very important research. So, as you can see humans spend too much time on the computer rather than doing much more important things."
5,"Dear @CAPS1, People use computer all over the world, for one reason or anotherr, but they are very necessary in our world. That is why computers have a good effect on people today. They help us contact distant family members. Kids rely on them for studying or homework. Adults need them for their jobs, like sending emails or typing a proposal. Thats why computers have a good effect on us. Like me, many kids have family across the ocean or just across the country, either way, contacting them is tough. Calling them @MONTH1 be expensive in most cases and sending letters certainly take to much time to reach them. With email, the message will be sent quickly and free. You can also have conversations through email with no problem. Anotherr very effective way to contact family is through Skype or a web cam. This way you can see your family from miles away in the comfort of your own home. Computers help kids too. Kids like me always have homework on the computer. It could be typing up a final draft of a paper or taking notes on a historical figure, either way they both require a computer. Sure, there are books to take notes on people, but do books type up papers? Kids and teenagers can also use them for studying. I constantly use the computer to practice Spanish buy using a website with worksheets a flash card to help me. Computers bot only help kids, they help adults too. MAny adults in @LOCATION1 and other countries are business men and woman. They are constantly sending emails, typing proposals and all those things. And without a computer all that would be very challenging. Business men are not the only ones doing that though. My father, an electrician, has to send out emails and documents about his latest project several times a week. Aside from work, we use them in our everyday lives. For example, ordering clothers and toys, but most popular is doing your taxes online. It is quicker easier and that is why @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 finish their taxes online. Computers have a good effect for people of this age. Not only i st hat my opinion, it is also more of a fact. They help us stay connected with distant relatives, help our children stay on top in school and help our parents and otherr adults in their jobs in everyday lives. Not only are they helpful, but they are necessary and I hope your agree with me."
5,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @DATE1, everywhere you look technology is being exercised and it is beneficial to many aspects in our lives @DATE1. Many engineers strive to improve on techno logic devices popularity, while others use it in communicate or relax. study conducted by @ORGANIZATION2 university, the computer is the most largely operated machine. The computer positively contributes to our education, economy, and entertainment. As i mentioned before the computer is beneficial to our education. An example of this is the school i attend, middle school. Here at we have over @NUM1 computers in use throughout the school day. These computers help the students complete research papers, typed assignments and other teacher requirement papers. By using the computer to complete research papers students save hours of scanning through books in the library and money on reading books. In addition, computers teachers in organizing files and entering grades online so students can check their. This is beneficial considering the amount of and assignments graded each week. Moreover, a computer called the ""parent portal"" allows the students to stay connected with school events that would not be mentioned otherwise in all, computer are way of. Besides education computers touch upon our economy as well. Now, due to the wide variety of computer selection, a computer is affordable, starting at prices as low as sixty dollars! This is a positive aspect of the computer because currently the has been enduring the economy since the depression in the. Consequently, the reason has made families start to cut many useful techno loge devices out of the. However, since the price of computers decreased purchase have stimulating. Also, the computer has mainly improved methods of. Instead of listening to a CD player you can download listen to while chatting online with friends. This is very helpful for last minute plan changes, because for those who do not own a telephone, communication @MONTH1 be, negatively affecting your time of entertainment. In addition, children can use internet in order to play games to take that mind off of a hard day at school, or an adult's rough work computer sin producing the you watch at home on the couch and the video game you ordered off of eBay. From Facebook and MySpace, to and ""gone with the wind."" Computers create a relaxing entertainment opportunity."
5,"Yes, I believe that computers benefits society because you can talk to other people, it helps you learn and lastly compote rs are apart of to days technology. First of all, computers have really progressed from the old type writer we used to have. Computers have helped to days life for a few different reasons. With computers, they help us learn or find things we didn't know. For example, if you have a project due on the @LOCATION1, then most likely you're probably not going to know much about it. If you go to the internet then you can find tons of things about it like who and what needs the @ORGANIZATION1 for water, how long the @LOCATION1 is, where its located or anything else abbot it. Also, another reason why computers help us learn is that, say your going to a new job interview and you have no idea where it is or how even to get there. If you type in the address and the internet will give you directions. Even if you dint know when your favorite to show is on tonight just type that in and the answer will be right in front of you. Secondly, why I believe that computers do benefits society is you can talk to other people from across the state, country, or world, or even just down the street. Facebook and @CAPS1 are very helpful as well, because one of my best friends moved away in second grade. Just before about Christmas i found her on Facebook and now we talk and catch up because we ha vent seen each other in years, @CAPS2 alone tack to her. Another reason why is that if someones Mon or dad is away at war or oversea's then the kids and parents could talk to them by using email, Skype, yahoo instant messenger, with the web cam or the telephone just @CAPS2 alone just typing back and fourth. You could also just use it for a job business to talk to your coworker or one of your workers on web cam to see things are going with profit, stores, etc. Lastly, why I think computers actually do help us is technology has come a long way. For example if you had to type something up you would of have to used a type writer and those things are hard to use. Today you just have to go onto @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and type it out. @CAPS3 @CAPS4 also has spell check, you could email it to someone, or even change the font, color, size of the font and much more. Another reason why is with iPhone or i touches now you dint have to be at home you could tacke out either one and just use the internet for whatever you want to. To find an app, find how long the @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 is, or even just to order a pizza but technology has come a long way. So this is why I agree with that computers help benefit our society because you can talk to other people, it helps you learn new things you didn't knew before and finally computers have changed a lot and they are apart of our technology. "
5,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 are you? As for me I am fine. I am writing this letter to explain to you why you should believe that computers have a positive effect on people. The reasons why I am writing this letter is that people could con tack with friends and families from faraway places, computers helps you learn more about different parts of the world and also computers helps people understand and learn more about life. That's why I believe you should believe that computers have a positive effect on people. First of all why I believe that computers have a positive effect on people is that people could con tack with friends and families from faraway places. An example to support my reason is that people from all parts of the world have families different places. And they cannot have a good con tack with them. But if they go on the internet they could their friends and families and chat with them. This shows that if you live in the @LOCATION2 and you have a friends that live in @LOCATION1 you could have a with I have families that lives and @LOCATION1 and it is hard to them. But when I am on the computer I can chat with them and have a fun time. This shows that you need a computer to catch up with friends and family. That's why I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Second of all why you should believe that computers have a positive effect on people is that computers helps you learn more about different parts of the world. An example is that if you don't know anything about a country or a place you could go on the internet a research and learn more about that place. This shows that computers is important to have. Another example is that when I have a project or a essay and I don't know about it. I could go on the computer and look it up. And by doing this it will help me on my project or essay. That's why I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Finally why I believe so is that computers helps you understand and learn more about life. An example is that if you don't know if something is right or wrong you could look it up and it @MONTH1 help you. This shows that computers can give ad vices. Another example is that computers could give you an idea on what to do. If you are trying a new recipe and you are not sure on @CAPS3 to make it. And it will give you the indigent and direction to make that food or snack you want. That's why I believe that you and all others should believe that computers have a positive effects. In conclusion why you should believe that computers have a positive effect is that people could con tack with friends and families, computers helps you learn about different parts of the world, and also computers helps you learn and understand more about life. I would hope you read and reread this letter and consider about believing that computers have a positive effect on people. That's why you should believe that computers have positive effect on people.

5,"Some experts are concerned that people are spending to much time on computers, and I believe that they are correct. Most kinds would per fer to be on the computer chatting with friends on line or spending hours on Facebook but what is the point of this when there is a whole to explore, they don't enjoy nature like they should, and they spend less time with family and friends. If you are on the computer twenty four hours a day, seven days a week how are you supposed to get enough exercise? Well that's the problem you don't get any exercise. Some might disagree with me but the truth is, moving your hand over the mouse doesn't count! A recent survey has been conduced and @CAPS2 said that out of the @PERCENT1 of kids who own a computer @PERCENT2 are overweight or in danger of being overweight. @CAPS2 is sad to think that technology has taken over so much that @CAPS2 is ruining peoples lives. I go in the computer @CAPS1 too, but I am always sure to ride my bike after or go for a hike with my family @CAPS1 of the times I have softball practice so I'm not able to go on the computer anyway. Now what about the beautiful things in nature @CAPS1 of us are missing? The outdoors is one thing most of us take advantage on, some of us have @CAPS3 seen a day lily are at night and new ones grow the very next day. This a fascinating are might @CAPS3 see because they have a computer screen in front of their face. Kids really should learn to balance technology and the more important things in life like protecting nature and exercising. Yes, I know, that some will disagree by saying, ""but i am saying the rain forest, or the @LOCATION1, by being a member of this website."" @CAPS2's true you are helping but doing @CAPS2 yourself would feel a whole lot better. For example you could get a group and clean up the streets in your neighborhood or help plant trees in the park. The most important thing in life is family and friends, technology should @CAPS3 get in the way of that. If you loose everything what is the one thing your will always have? Loving family and friends of course! If family is so import and then why would kid want to be on the computer than at a family picnic? Is is because technology is taking over their life and clouding their vision of the more important things life has to offer. Don't you sometimes wish you were a little kid again running bare footed a field with your parents? That could be some what have if you got off the chair you have been sitting in for three hours straight and took a hike with your family. I might not be making much sense but being with family in person is better than instant messaging someone you just meet who lives half way across the world! I know that a ton of people are going to disagree with me when they read this but, I think technology is ruining some peoples lives. If you think about @CAPS2 a computer is like a @CAPS4@CAPS5 @CAPS6 , @CAPS2 has a sugar sweet coating but when you get the full force of @CAPS2, @CAPS2 traps you in and won't let go. A computer is ruining lives and experts have a right to be worried about people's health! All of us should get more exercise, spend more time in Nature, and be with family and friends more often than sitting on a chair glued to a computer screen."
5,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I @CAPS3't you agree that computers benefit society? I sure do. I find my computer benefits the society because you can interact with others online. Its easy to find entertainment and @CAPS4 is extremely helpful and profitable. Now you @MONTH1 not believe computers are "" Society friendly"" but I am here to argue that statement. Now, one thing I love about computers is now easily you can interact with people whether they're miles away or right in your neighborhood, you could chat with them in the push of a button. For instance, my friends all have the infamous? Facebook account. All I have to do is go online, click my chat box and click their name and then @CAPS5! were talking. And the better part is you @CAPS3't have to share any personal details ( @CAPS6 @CAPS7, phone number etc..) to chat on Facebook. Wow wasn''t that easy? Did you ever turned on your @CAPS8. scanned through Channels and say ""@CAPS9 goods on @CAPS8?"" @CAPS11, with a computer. threes always something to watch. Whethe @CAPS4 old a new, fake a real, live or not, the computer has many things tool/ watch. You could pull up your @CAPS12 browser and go on @CAPS13 (A video site) and watch their wonderful variety of filling. There are at least @NUM1 million videos on @CAPS13 and @NUM2 being watched/uploded per day. Infact the ""@CAPS14"" views @NUM3+ video a day without noticing @CAPS4. If your looking for stand up, you could type in ""@CAPS15 @CAPS16! If you're looking to action, you type in Chan . Basically, the computer and the bad wide web things to do. Now, @CAPS17 stating those two things, @CAPS4 has come to my attention that the computer is also extremely helpful. Say if you have an extremely big test/report due tomorrow, you can study for @CAPS4 online. You can go on Google and type in your projects subject and get over @NUM4 results in a fraction of a second depending on your bandwidth. Now, the computer is also profitable. Did you know the two people who made Google are dirt rich? They made more than the @ORGANIZATION1 and the company @ORGANIZATION1 makes the mostly used computer system. So once again, the computer is extremely helpful and profitable. This is exactly why I believe the computer benefits the society. The computer lets you interact with other, keeps you entertained and is very helpful and profitable. So quite frankly, you should believe that the computer is society beneficial. Thank you for your time."
5,"Dear editor, I think that people are spending too much time on the computer. Because of this, people are getting less exercise, they are not spending enough time outdoors and the dint spend as much time with their family and friends. Exersicing is an important part of one's daily scheduled. I have a friend who exercises everyday. She is the healthiest person I know and rarely spends anytime on the computer. But, she knows someone who is almost her complete opposite. He hardly ever exercises and spends @NUM1 hours on the computer each day. He has also been diagnosed with diabetes and is obese. These are the type of health problems that are faced because of lack of exercise and too much computer time. Experts say that people should get at least @NUM2 minutes of exercise every day. But, because more and more people are spending time on computers, this is almost impossible. Studies done at @ORGANIZATION1 show that @PERCENT1 of kids under the age of @NUM3 are obese or at the risk of becoming obese because they are not getting enough exercise. You don't want that number to increase do you? There are other problems that people face because of too much time on the computer. People are spending less time outdoors and more time inside at a desk. My friend @PERSON1 spends way too much time on her computer and not enough outside. She failed a science project because she was on her computer, Rather than outside comparing the leaves from different trees. Doctor @PERSON2 is a child physiologist and when he asked kids if they would rather play outside or be on a computer, @PERCENT2 of them said computer. This shows that people on computers are not only young, but they want to be on the computer more than be outside. This is a number that, in my opinion, is too high. Lastly, there is the problem of people not spending enough time with their family and friends. By this I mean face to face time, not just video chatting with your friends on Facebook. This has caused tension in relationships. My friend @PERSON3 didn't go to her family reunion but stayed at home on the computer and at the next family get together, she was ostracized because she didn't go to the reunion. High @ORGANIZATION1 guidance counselor @PERSON4 says that @NUM4 out of @NUM5 friendships are ruined because kids dint spend enough face to face time with their friends but are on the computer. These are all god reasons why less time on the computer and more time exercising, outside, and with family and friends will make your life happier and healthier."
5,"Dear @CAPS1 of The Local Newspaper: @CAPS2 students are promoted to higher grade levels, more teachers will require research papers. In my opinion @CAPS10 a computer helps me complete my research paper and the contents in it are the best it can be. What makes students and parents more happy to see @CAPS3's on their child's paper? Advances in technology. there should be advances in technology because they teach hand eye coordination, it gives the ability to learn about far away places, and people, and even allows people to talk online with other people. To begin there should be advances in technology because it teaches hand eye coordination. In a recent poll seen in TIME magazine, it showed that @PERCENT1 of people who use computers had a large increase in their coordination, people were not @CAPS2 clumsy and poorly coordinated. @PERSON1, a professional tennis player @CAPS4 that, ""@CAPS5 I started using a computer, I always, would play tennis for living and it was a bad choice because I was poorly coordinated. I always missed the tennis ball in matches. So I decided to stop. Then I started to use the computer more and my coordination improved. Now I barely miss any tennis balls."" @CAPS6, @CAPS10 advances in technology will improve and teach hand eye coordination. Another reason there should be advances in technology is because it gives people the ability to learn about far away places and people. @PERSON2 @CAPS7 a writer from @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS4 that, ""People like to research a place @CAPS5 they go on vacation or a business trip because they would like to know more about it."" Not knowing anything about your vacation destination is like not knowing what's for dinner tonight, it is clearly unreasonable. Recent studies show that the more a person knows about their vacation destination the more enjoyable it is. Thus, the more vacations they go one which is profitable for airplane companies. Also knowing about the different cultures of the people in far away places gives people a better perspective of the world they live in. Thus, @CAPS10 advances in technology will give the ability to learn about far away places and people. Furthermore, @CAPS10 advances in technology will allow people to talk online with other people. @PERSON3 @CAPS8 the creator of @CAPS9 @CAPS4 that, ""@CAPS10 online chat programs will help people communicate with each other. @CAPS9 has been beneficial to everybody. For example, it helps people reconnect with their former friends. It is also very beneficial to students because if they forget a homework assignment they can log onto @CAPS9 and ask a classmate."" A recent article found on @ORGANIZATION2, showed that online chat programs helped people communicate with each other. @CAPS6, @CAPS10 advances in technology will allow people to talk online with other people. In conclusion, @CAPS10 advances in technology will improve hand eye coordination, teach people about far away places and people, and allows people to talk online with other people. When voting on this decision please take part and support advances in technology, it will be beneficial to everybody. Thank you for your time."
5,"Dear editors of the @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 morning, my sister wakes me up to go to school. She uses her cell phone to set an alarm. A few years ago, my mom would come in and tell us it was time to get up. Now, we have one small device that we carry around with us to do our work. Most everyone has cellphone now, and it does much more than allow people to talk to one another from two different places. Now we can play games, go on the. These advances in the technology are making us very selfish. I, for one, do not approve. For starters, all of these new and improved gadgets are time consuming. With all the things to do in the world, we could all be doing something helpful, fun, or productive. Don't you agree? I mean, if you consider the idea that we all could be hitting the gym or studying for school tests and quizzes, then most teenagers would be in much better shape, physical, and mentally, @CAPS2. @PERSON1, my aunt an former physicist, said. The rate at which most students and kids grow increasingly more obese, @CAPS3 because of these new ideas involving phones and iPod's are completely sickening. The more time we spend using these items, the more we oppose the idea of being active? You can clearly see how we are growing less energetic, and much more careless of our time. Furthermore, the advances in today's society are pushing on the boundaries at internet safety. Sure, people might claim that they can block out other people, but sometimes when someone posts something on the web, they don't always hide it well enough. They could have blackmailed one of your friend into committing a crime, right? That happened to one of my cousins, @CAPS3 last year. The police took a long time to find her after she had been kidnapped, because the person who kidnapped her hid the evidence by a chain of blackmails. Do you see how important it is to spend less time on these silly computers? It sucks us into a virtual world that is sometimes 'bloody' or 'warlike? My brother learned swearing from the new & advanced game of @CAPS5. It's a fighting game (@CAPS6!) I implore your company to make the Right decision and write to help pull us off of our butts and get us up and going strong again. I hope you take my advice, and i thank you for your extremely valuable time and effort."
5,"Dear Local @CAPS1: I'm sitting at the couch thinking about what I should do for vacation. I know I definitely want to take a trip somewhere to do same creative writing, but my notebooks are all scattered, I don't know how to quickly contact someone who could help and I have no idea about the country that I plan to visit. I take a last look at my notebooks strewn about the closet looking very much like a tornado swept through and I find solution on the highest shelf my laptop. First, I highly agree with the people who think computers are useful. Three effects they have on people who use them isle are fantastic. Compare a person with a laptop to one without. The person with a laptop @MONTH1 be a busy business person and have to converse with many people from long distances a part, so they use e'mail and @ORGANIZATION1. They travel places with people at their fingertips. However a person without a laptop could be busy moving from place to place just to meet these people. Their schedule could be chaotic. Conversations over a chat system are fast and effective. Take my story for example. My mom hates wasting, so instead of me driving to a friend we @CAPS2. Saves money and time! In addition, I happen to be a writer who write often everyday in many notebooks. I've written so much over the years that my notebooks are piling all over my room. What organizational tool could help me in this situation? Why a laptop of course! One laptop or computer store a bunch of and editing a breeze. Anyone who with data and writing would be crazy not to have a computer! What you a room notebooks that you buy of, or a single, computer with tons of space and back up? You tell me. Computers encourage users to be more organized! Respectively, computers are resource for a millions of pages information. They're similar to libraries. But think about a library and then imagine a computer. One you have to walk around to seek your information and with the other, knowledge is merely a click away. Some @MONTH1 argue that computer websites are not entirely reliable I beg to differ. There are specific websites on computers with suffixes like '.org' and'.gov' and even'.edu'. These websites contain proven factual information and more great resources for research. By using computers I have acquired greater knowledge and have found computers beneficial. They have effectively made me more intelligent as a person. In conclusion, it's my strong opinion that those who use computers gain nothing but the positive effects, and these include money/gassaving conversations through @CAPS2 and email organization and increased intelligence from reading. I've decide to take my creative writing on my laptop and in doing so learned the storm."
5,"As the people of the world are starting to use the computer more and more, I think it has a extremely pOSitive effect on people. Computers are not all fun and GAmes they help with other things as well. For example, some of the amazing things the computer are; teach hand eye coordination. give people all over the world a chance to learn about the places, people and culture from far away places, and last hit not least, it is another way to allow people to talk online with their friends. Now let me explain more about what a pOSitive effect the computer is for the millions of people that use one. The computer today is such a great thing to have in your house. It is not for just GA off and playing video GAmes on, it is also very helpful in the education of young children, teens, parents, and even grandparents. when you use the computer there OS so much you can learn. For instance lets say you have a in your stoical or history about the country or and you don't know a thing about it. What do you do? You should log onto you computer find a reliable website and boom you are learning facts about @LOCATION1 that you would have never know until you logged onto the computer. The computer is also a great way to practice and get better using your hand eye coordination. First you need to learn about the of the keys and where they are pOSitioned on the keyboard. After you have that skills, you should try to look at the computer screen. and not be working down at you finger keys. Not only is that not helping you hand eye coordination, but it is causing you to type much slower than you would if you were looking at the screen. The computer truly is unbelievable. Are you one of thOSe people who's parents don't you get a phone because use of how much it cOSts without even the cOSt of testing? Well if you are, the computer help you out with that problem as well!! There are bunches of different ways to talk to your friends and family on the computer. For example, you could use @CAPS1 to instant your friends or Facebook to learn more and more about somebody. The comp. is so Handy! So lets recap on what we learned! The computer helps people learn about different places all over the world helps w/ hand eye coordination, and lets you talk to your friends! I think the comp is a in every household."
5,"North @CAPS1 courier, I would like to give you my opinion on the usage of computers. I am a person who supports the advances in technology and believe computers have a positive effect on people, @CAPS2 ran benefit people in many ways. The three most important ways to me is that @CAPS2 helps with hand eye coordination, gives people another source to retain knowledge from, and lastly @CAPS2 realize to another way for people communicate. Handeye coordination is an awesome skill to have in our society. In a country, being the @LOCATION2, that revolves around sports, hand eye coordination really helps out. Using the computers really helps harness and train your hand eye for sports such as baseball, basketball and many more. Using the computers for hand eye coordination will really help the @LOCATION2 to develop some world class athletes. We also live in a country where their are so many drivers and cars on the road. We have a problem with bad drivers here in the @LOCATION2 so if they improve their coordination maybe the numbers of car accidents and fatalities involving automobile will decrease. Well how in computers help with with hand eye coordination yow ask? I'll tell you how, by people using fun gaming sites, like luniosity.com, which is a website with games for brain training. @CAPS2 helps with hand eye coordination, concentration, memorization, and problem solving. They help your brain in all of these categories just by having cute and fun little game. As you can see in the @LOCATION2 we need improved hand eye coordination and @CAPS2 could do many positive things for the country. We cam improve @CAPS2 just by computer. To retain knowledge about other cultures, places, people and miscellaneous things makes to amazing thanks to the computer we have for this information besides books. have the internet and computers you can know about what you want when you type in the subject into a search engine like Google or yahoo. People can learn all of this wonderful and interesting information about things they of never known before. @CAPS2 also helps kids like to find information for reports and. There are truly you can learn on the internet. You can learn about or. Maybe the difference between an element and a compound, or even just the definition of the word sauces than is a to @LOCATION1. You can get so much knowledge from the computers/internet. Communication is another huge part of our daily lives. Most people have home phones or call phones, but for the ones who dint they need as me en of communication. On the computer you can use instant @CAPS3 or email; @CAPS4 twitter, or MySpace as well. The computer gives people who don't have phones another way to communicate with others. Even if you do have a phone and someone you known is overseas. Instead of wasting money on a long distances just use one of the systems y've mentioned. The same thing goes for our military, they don't have phones to call home so they communicate via the computer. Communicating via computer is just another reason why the computer is so important. So as I conclude my letter to you, the north @CAPS1 courier, I shall restate that I do support technology because they do have positive effects on people. The positive effects that are the most major are @CAPS2 teaches hand eye coordinating helps people with another source to gain knowledge, and lastly @CAPS2 allows another way to communicate with people. I will tell you once again computers benefits society and do have positive effects."
5,"Dear Local Newspaper, I think the effects that computers have on people are bad, and should be stopped. I mean don't get me wrong computers help people, but a lot of people go on it everyday, some computers can get viruses, and there are much more activities to do other than on a computer. I hope to persuade you about the horrible effects a computer has on people. Do you know how many people use the computer? Well, according to @ORGANIZATION1 over @NUM1 billion people use a computer worldwide. The problem we are facing today is that too many people are on a computer, most of them are teens. According to @PERSON1 about @PERCENT1 of teens spend most of their time on an computer. Facebook, @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2 are the most common places to find teens. I would know that because I have a Facebook myself. I've had one for almost a year, and you should see all the people who have one. My friend wanted me to get one because she said she had one one wanted me to get one too. So I did and then I found out that more then half of my grade had a Facebook. In my own words I honestly think the computer can be addicting, especially when your on a worldwide account like Facebook. There are many people on the computer and if must be stopped. In addition, another reason is computers occasionally get viruses. According to @CAPS3.com, the average adult gets about @NUM2 to @NUM3 viruses a year. My friend @PERSON2 was on his computer typing a report, and then his computer shut down. Then @NUM4 seconds @CAPS4 the computer said you have a virus. The next day @PERSON2 told me he didn't have his report because the virus wiped out all his information. About @PERCENT2 of viruses can cause a computer to shut down and it is hard to reboot it. Some places have made virus scans such as McGee. and @CAPS5, but sometimes they can't catch the virus. @PERCENT3 of people who say that a virus was cough by the virus scan they have, their computer freezes up and you can't delete the virus, viruses must be terminated, so the computer can work properly. Thats another reason to why computers affect people in a bad way. Furthermore, people think that the computer is their everything. They're wrong! There is a lot of activities that they can do other than be on a computer. According to @CAPS6. Burn the average person between the ages of @NUM5 and @NUM6 spend more then @NUM7 hours on a computer. There are many other options of activities like call your friends and get together, that's why they invented the cell phone, play a sport, read a book, spend time with family for @PERSON3's @CAPS7! Don't spend all your time on the computer. About @PERCENT4 of teens who are on the computer alto tend to get into lower colleges later in life. That is my final reason of the bad effects a computer has. In conclusion, computers can cause a bad influence due to viruses, too much time on it, and not doing other things. I hope you can see my point to this and please send me a response as soon as possible."
5,"Dear editor, Computers have a good effect on humans. The reason is because you can interact with friends and family that they know, the computer @MONTH1 be portable so you can still get outside, and lastly people can research places where they want to go on vacation. These reasons are how computers have a good effect on humans. To begin with, seeing people in person is not the only way to communicate, on the computer there is many ways. There are chat rooms, that have typing to each other. Take my friend @PERSON5 for example, he used to live in @LOCATION2 with all his friends and family until business came along. His business transfer ed @PERSON5 all the way to @LOCATION1. Thank god he had a computer, because other wise he would not have able to communicate with his friends. @PERSON5 is not the only person in which he is transfer ed far away from home. In fact, @PERSON4 showed @PERCENT1 of people with a computer tend to talk to friends and family more often because they can do it whenever they need. Gene a psychiatrist states that when someone in a family has to leave to go on business, then that family will start relying on a computer to communicate. Do you want to lose a friend or family member? Moreover, computers @MONTH1 be portable. If a computer is portable then you can see nature and still use the computer to get the job done. Take my cousin @PERSON2 is a teacher and always has to do his students grades during the weekend. He was bummed out because he could never get outside. So for his birthday, he got a portable computer, this allowed him to go outside and do his job while getting fresh air and seeing nature. @PERSON2 is one of many lucky people that has had this happen to them. @PERSON6 has shown that @PERCENT2 of teachers buy portable computers so they can see nature and get fresh air while doing their job. @PERSON1, proved that if a teacher doesn't get any fresh air while doing their job then they can make a valuable mistake or even get sick. Would you, a teacher, want to get sick with no fresh air or be healthy working out doors? Lastly, there is more to do on computers than doing work and communicating with friends and family. You can research places for vacation. My aunt @PERSON3 had always dreamed of going on vacation but couldn't find any information on fun, outdoor places. Until, she got her hands on a computer. This way she found a fun place and left the country for week. @PERSON3 is not the only person this has happened to. In fact, @ORGANIZATION1 shows that @PERCENT3 of people hesitate to go on vacation because they don't know about the country or place."
5,"Dear @CAPS1, I remember when I was younger my paren'ts got two laptops for themselves. Internet use was always available, interaction of online chat. It was extremely exciting for them. On the other hand, I got to sit home and watch them have fun. I couldn't go outside, or hang out with friends just because I was stranded in sided as they enjoyed the computer. I strongly feel as if computers do not benefit society. People spend too much time using the internet than exercising, nobody gets to enjoy the beauty of nature, and there is less interaction with family and friends. There are many holes being dog while computers one still being used and bought. Our society is just going downhill from here. People don't need to be sitting at home inside breathing reused air while using the computer. Proffessor @PERSON3, a health generalist, stated on @ORGANIZATION2 news that @PERCENT1 of all people around @LOCATION1 would rather be on the computer at home doing nothing than going outside and/or getting some kind of exercise. Could you imagine all of those unhealthy people not worrying about anything except their computer? the only thing computers do for us these days is abandon our free time. @CAPS2 waist @PERCENT2 of there spare time on their computer. If technology decreases there new games people play, and sites people use, it is like for people to get out of the house and do something healthy for themselves. @PERSON1, owner of @ORGANIZATION1, said ""I have never seen in my entire life, so many people using there computers and internet. Its been quite sometimes when over one billion @CAPS2 are online on a typical weekend. "" @PERSON1 later mentions "" it's kind of depressing of how much time they spend on computers, than outside and enjoying nature."" Not only is exercising time headed down the drain, but our used to be "" beautiful"" nature is as well. Many young kids these days are watching @CAPS3, they see computer game commercials there paren'ts buy them the game, and all of a sudden they are on it @NUM1. Since adults aren't doing there part by idolizing these kids to persuade them to run around outside and do something healthy. The kids need to step up for a change! Did you know global warming is caused by the minimum density in the air? If we have almost to no children or adults running around outside, our world is not flowing too well. Hence our budget is low, and pollution is extremely off the wall; our nature is going from beatify to less and lesser. @PERSON2, a government official has survey @NUM2 people from each state asking about how much time they spend weekly of just enjoying nature and realizing the beauty of it. The survey reads one in every @NUM3 people thought breathe in the beauty for at least @NUM4 minuets, a week. I mean come on; that's pathetic. Maybe if we surely excluded computers and technology for a while, global warming won't be NASCAR. I remember when I was about @NUM4 years old an I never once got to meet my other family besides my siblings. It was pretty sad because I'm always told I have a huge family that is very known to our town but I have no clue who they are ! this is all because technology was invented. Never once have I ever been outside and relaxed besides when I got on and off the bus for school. My paren'ts stand me in my house as they use the computer. The other day I just found out what ""show"" is because my moms computer brake and now I am get introduced to my other family along with the freedom of going outside. Ever since my mom's computer brake she has lots of free time to spend with me. Technology ruined my childhood as a kid and without it you get to open up the real importance of life. Would you want to become obese, like through global warming, and/or to not interact with family or outside nature? Its said how @PERCENT3 of these reasoning's are caused by the excessive use of technology and computers. Let's just get rid of it all! Thank you for your time @CAPS1!"
5,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you be live that the advances in our technology are not good for our society you must be misunderstanding computers have a positive affect on the people in our community by giving us well hand and eye coordination and giving us the ability to seek and find information to learn. It can also allow people to communicate online with others. Hand and eye coordination is an important thing that helps us everyday. @CAPS2 new technology such as computers, can help us with that skill, we should use it. @PERSON1 of @ORGANIZATION1 says, ""Computers do help us a lot; almost @PERCENT1 of active computer users do improve their hand and eye coordination just by using the computers for a small amount of time everyday."" @CAPS3 and education are essential, especially now; the more you learn, the better salary you get. With this new technology, you can earn degrees and learn in a short period of time. My aunt got her @CAPS4 online about six months ago, and just because of that, got promoted at her job. Gaining valuable @CAPS3 online doesn't just go for adults but children as well. @CAPS2 they have a report on @CAPS5 or need somee help on their homework, these new technologies are one of the most effective, fastest ways to learn and find information. @PERSON2, a doctor that specializes in @CAPS6 emotions/feelings says in the @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 last month that, ""in this new millennium, preteens and teenagers simply love the new advances in technology, and @CAPS2 we want them to learn, then we can take this tool and have them use it."" Computers are also a great way to communicate it's fast and easy. I have an uncle who lives in @LOCATION1, and we rarely get to see each other due to the distance, some we catch up by messaging each other by social networks or emails. It's even free, unlike the costly long distance calls. The communication is also great for businesses. A company can reach out and contact their customers to reschedule an appointment, give receipts, advertised and many other things. Computers are essential and effective technology that are use by people around the country and world. They improve hand eye coordination, allow people to gain @CAPS3 and education, and gives people opportunity to communicate with others. this is another great and useful step in our communities around the world."
5,"There are many reasons that computers are a good thing for the world. They let us learn about far away places without us even having to leave our homes. Another reason why computers are so important is we can talk to our family without having to even travel if they live in another country or another state or even if they are your neighbors. Lastly they teach us hand eye coordination that is a much needed skill that can help you get through life. The fantastic thing about computers are that we can learn about far away places without having to leave the comfort of our home. People of all different countries @MONTH1 be inquisitive about where they came from. They @MONTH1 also wonder how other countries are doing government wise or even economic (stocks). All of this is possible and much quicker then watching the news or weather channel. Computers allow us to search the web and arm ourselves with knowledge. The marvelous things about computers is the speed of them. You could be waiting for a stock update on the news channel and wait maybe ten or even twenty minutes. However if you go on your computer and use the internet it makes you life much easier and the faster you can look up so mes part of knowledge the faster you might be able to make dinner or even enjoy a nice walk outside and breathe in the nice icy crisp cold air. Also radios and television stations might be a little of with their accuracy. Maybe a minute later there is a suicide bombing that you might like to know about or the stock might go up one hundred points or go down one hundred points. This is all valuable information that people would want to be one hundred percent accurate. Secondly you can stay in touch with your family even if they live in a different country or in a different state. With web cams that are attachable to some computers or some that are embedded within the computers you can talk to them. My grandma was in the hospital once and I wasn't allowed to see her since I was to young. Since the technology of web cams were invented I was able to see her on the screen instead of seeing her in real life but at least i was able to see if she was doing okay. Webcams are a could way also in discussions. Such as you and your friend are joking and she says something you think is rude but you can't tell that she being sarcastic you might get into a fight. If you have a web cam you can talk to each other on the computer and see if she is being sarcastic or not. Technology @MONTH1 be one of the greatest inventions that has come forth and @MONTH1 be the best one that will ever be made. That last important thing that you need to know about computers is that they teach you hand eye coordination. Handeye coordination is an important skill that is acquired. This is an important skill because it allows you to sauced in life such as having to write. This skill is also important if you have a job that involves computers because you need to know how to type and move you fingers fast if you want to sauced in this well payed job. This skill also helps provide a wide range of other successful jobs in the world. Computers in the long run are magnificent machines that makes life a lot easier and fun in acquiring knowledge. If you don't have a good hand eye cord nation you should get a computer because it will help a lot. however if you get a computer you must update it regularly so you computer will not become slow and start crashing on you. In conclusion computers are the best thing that has been introduced to man kind so far in this world. It allows you to do do many things such as news and how the world is doing globally and how the economy is doing globally. Also it allows you to stay in touch with your family no matter how far you live or what country that you life in. Lastly computers teach you the important skill of hand eye cord nation. Everyone in the world should be able to have a computer so that they could obtain the knowledge that they would Ned to sauced in life."
5,"Dear local newspaper, I think that computers are great for our society. Computers have a positive effect on people. They teach to people hand eye coordination, and about places all over the world. Computers are also great for talking online to family and friends. Computers teach people hand eye coordination. They help people to get familiar with looking at a screen and typing letters to form words. Computers are excellent for students that play the piano, like me. It helps you to be able to look at the music and have your fingers know where to play. The computers helps with the piano because they both involve you looking at a screen, or music. While your fingers know what to do. So I think computers helps children and teens to have better hand eye coordination. Computers are also very helpful to everyone because it is great for researching facts, or even just looking for somewhere to go on vacation. Say you just got home from school, and your teacher had assigned you to write a two page paper on the @CAPS1 @CAPS2. You would not be able to do it by memory, you would need facts. So you should go to the library, but no one can take you. Well if you have a computer, it is a great way to research a topic for school. You don't have to leave your home, you can even stay in your pajamas. Computers give you the information that you need. Or if your planning a vacation in @LOCATION1, and don't know where to stay, then the internet will get you right there and give you great options. Another thing computers are great for is talking. How so you say, well you can got to A.I.M. online. You can have conversations with all your friends and family. This year my brother, and my closest cousin to me, went to college. Now I only see them about twice a year, it is so quiet without them, especially at my house. If I want to ever talk with my brother, it is great like he is in my home again. He sends me pictures of his college, friends, and any fun places that he goes. So without computers I would practically never see my brother, or talk to him. Local newspaper please consider my opinion, I feel that computers benefit are society. They leave a positive effect on people in the community and world. Computers teach teens, and children excellent hand eye coordination, and helps people like me to play the piano more smoothly and exact. Computers are also great for looking up facts for school when the library is not available. The internet also keeps me closer to my brother, whose in college, because we can chat and send pictures to each other. So please take my opinion into consideration. Thank you."
5,"Dear Newspaper, I am writing this better to explain to you how more people in our society would benefit from using computer you can do work in less time it would take to do it manually. You can interact and make more friends by talking or web charting. Not to forget that it is more entertaining. That is what computers were made for. To help us with tasks or for our personal use. How do computers though help us with work? Lets say that you are having a business meeting and you have to write a five page report with pictures and a graphs. It would take you twice the time to do that by hand then with a computer. With a computer, you can type you work which makes it much neater and looks more professional, You can copy and paste your images that you can @CAPS1 on the internet. With graph making software, you can easily plug in the data you have collected and the computer will do the rest. If you had to do this by hand, you would have to write extremely neat, @CAPS1 pictures in a newspaper or ma be, even draw them. Then you would have to make the graph by hand making sure not to mess up. It makes it twice as hard, to do a simple task with a computer. What if you want to talk to a friend? With a computer you can easily talk to a friend as to having to write a letter or talk on the phone with a computer you can either chat with a person with writing or even being able to see them on you computer screen. Instead of just hearing voice or waiting two or three days to talk to them. If you have a laptop you can talk to them were every they go or you go. Being able to see the person at your convenience to talk without having to leave you house is a very good thing to have. The benefit are major and it doesn't cost anything to chat. If you have a friend or relative that lives very far away, you can easily go at talk and have a video conference. What about entertainment? The computer is a very valuable too! but we can fun, we can play games or watch videos at as convenience. They don't cost a lot to download at all, they can be played with friends on a web chat or by yourself. Videos you can watch all the time with no ads to int erupt you can pause the video too. This is more efface, they care I very convenient for the average person. Playing games were ever you go is good and again don't art to play or. In conclusion I think that people would be more from using computers this is because it is easier to work with. We can interact with each other. Use it for entertainment. Technology was made to make things easier do we should take advantage of it."
5,"Has a computer helped you ever answered hard question or type up an essay for school for work? I know a computer has helped me far years so why would I terminate it or want it gone. Heres the controversy, many experts believe computers don't benefit society but people, such as myself, believe the exact opposite. Their are many benefits to coning a computer such as they're always a source of information, allow you to talk online with others, and they can help people with their school and job loans. No matter what the problem, don't you believe a computer is always a source of information that could help? A computer has endless information on any topic unlike books. This is because everyone, from the most to the least intelligent people, have their opinions, ideas, and hard facts in a computer on the web. I once watched a movie of a man who despised computers and new technology. Thus, for most of his life he wondered the world with no hint or clue as where to @CAPS4 in search of a rare artifact called the @CAPS1 diam on. He never found the diam ond but his son who searched it on the internet found out the root Geo from @CAPS1 meant underground in ancient @CAPS2 culture. due to a computer he found the diam ond underground, beneath the ancient @CAPS2 temples. Therefore, I believe if people would embrace technology such as computers they would find many things that they never thought of. also, computers give you the ability to chat online with family and friends. Many people use computers to stay in touch when they have no available phones, with a computer you could chat with your friend down the street or your family member on vacation in another country. No matter where you are a compute can always be on available form of communication. for example, the only way many of our soldiers fighting wars stay in touch with their loved ones back home is by talking to them online with a computer. One thing I know is no matter how old to probably about @NUM1, if you have a job or go to school you have used a computer to help you with @CAPS4. Whether it was getting an answer to a homework question or researching a person for a project, we all use computers. Computers even have the ability to help you make brochures or pamphlets. This can greatly help you advertise if that is something you do at work. Also, many people don't have the neatest handwriting so they type their essay or letter to their boss, you can even choose what type of handwriting it types. No matter the case, with work a computer always helps. Yes, I do believe computers benefit the society. Althourgh, some experts do disagree with me and believe they can become an addition. Still take my suggestions seriously and continue to use your computer. Remember, it is always a source of info., you can chat online, and it helps with work."
5,"Computers are today a common ha var hold item and some people think its bad for so city when in reality its oir most useful tool nowadays. It supply's an easy access to information along with preparing skills for future generations. And giving from life's sometimes to cruel days throigh gaming. Before computers world spend hoirs in books and find what there looking for. The computer solves this. This non as simple as typing what oi need to know and hi ting the enter key. This improves grades for children and life for adult solving a into the withoit leaving yoir home and allowing news like yoirself to spread into at the moment it's known. It also creates an interactive place for anyone in the world with thing like and or question and answers this allows us not only yo ask opinions and compare responses but to get statistics that @MONTH1 help us make life altering designs.

It also improves at the same time hand eye coordination. So when yoi have a ruff day tents to brings people happiness. So computers all next and put yoir mind to hard work but @MONTH1 yoi yoir dreams with a little well limit!!"
5,"It has come to my attention that there is an argument about whet or not computers have a positive effect on people. I think that computers do have a positive effect on people because with computers people can get needd infoermation that could be used to help them, it lets people talk to friends and family around the world and also computers teach people new things. Therefoere, computers have a positive effect on people. students whether it be at college o'er elementary schools almost always go to a computer when they have to foe projects foer their class without computers students wouldn't be able to get the infoermation that they need and could cause them to get a bad grade on the project which could result in grades getting worse and worse. Adults use computers often foer work and planning, so if there weren't any computers then it would mean thousands of people would lose their jobs and could foerget scheduled plans that could be important and could result in causing families to lose money, not enough money to pay bills and could result in losing their homes causing them to live on the streets. Evry person has at least two or more friends or relatives that live in a different place in the world that is not easy to stay in contact with so it could result in having to use long distance calling which could waste alto of money. However, with computers people can talk to Friends and relatives from around the world without having to spend any extra money on phone calls to their friends and family members from around the world. Also if something happens to a family member of somewhere around where a relative lives we could use the internet to check in with them to see if everything is OK. Many parents are using computers to help teach their kids at a nearly age so they are ready foer when they go to school foer the first time. Also computers are used at schools mainly to teach the students about things that they need to know foer the future, as a result computers become very use full to people when they are trying to learn how to do something wheat her its foer school. college or a job computers are of tun used daily foer important things that we need to learn foer our lives in the future sow e won't need any extra help Turing to learn how to do something. Also we would be bale to help people when they need help if we already knew what to do. As you Can see computers do have a positive effect on people because people can use computers to help them gain the infoermation they need foer school or work, it lets you check in with friends and family from around the world and finally computers help teach us very important life lessons. In conclusion, computers have a positive effect on people and it could save a person from losing things that are.important to themselves or others. "
5,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you know, more and more people are starting to use computers. In my opinion, I think the computer does benefit society in many ways. One positive effect it has on people is that they can communicate. Through the computer, people are able to send messages to each other. If someone doesn't have a phone or car, they can simply go online, write a message, and click the send button. This is an easy way to communicate with someone who lives half way around the world @CAPS2 well. If you have family members who live far away, you can also send them pictures of yourself, friends/family, and places you've been to. They can receive them and also send pictures back. Another positive effect computers have on people is that they can learn new things. The internet allows you search different topics and basically has everything and anything you could ever think of. If you go on @ORGANIZATION1 and type in a word like 'dog,' you'll see a bunch of websites that will take you to other websites that are just about dogs. You can find a list naming types of dogs, how old a dog can live up to, where most dogs are found, how to care for them well, etc. The internet lets you explore new things and help find ideas. You name it; they got it. The computer also ca mes in handy when you have nothing to do. If you're bored and can't play outside because the weather is bad or you broke your leg, you can play computer games, listen to music online, or write your own story on a word document. Playing computer games can teach you techniques to help play a game better, @CAPS2 well @CAPS2 keep you busy. If you want to listen to music to keep yourself entertained, you can go on @CAPS3 or other sites and find any song you want to hear. It's better than listening to the radio because sometimes you don't like the song that's giving. If you're also in the mood to write a story, you can open a word document or if you just want to type whats on your mind. @CAPS2 you can see, I think the computer is a fascinating tool to use. You can communicate, learn new things, and keep yourself entertained if you're not able to do something active. Just remember, whenever you can, go out and play or hang out with friends and family."
5,"To the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, This day in age, computer technology rules the world. It's where we get our news, music, shopping and even entertainment. Sounds great right? But there are some big downsides to this box of information. Such as, this gadget is taking over peoples lives and keeping them from exercising. Now a days, people are even loosing human interaction from these marvelous toys. And finally, computers are very expensive electronics, they have much up keep which costs you money ultimately making you depressed. As you can see, although there are some great pros to computers, there are also pretty big downfalls that you havn't thought of yet. As I previously stated, computers are taking away from people exercising. We're all becoming quite lazy. People rather stau at their computer screens playing grand theft auto or Facebook stalking than going outside to play a game of soccer with your friends at the empty field down the street. @PERCENT1 of the @LOCATION1 goes without physical domain for at least a @DATE1 and a half. @PERCENT2 of those people rather just tau at home on their computers. This is a disgrace! We cannot let this continue. We must change the way we live and get rid of this unhealthy appliance we call a computer. Of all my reason that computers are bed, this is by far the most disturbing. People are having less, and less human interactions as computers become more popular. Now you, can d everything from your computer. Soon people will be marrying them. Oh wait, that's already happened. Just yesterday, I read in the newest issue of @CAPS4 @CAPS5 that a man married a character in his computer game. There was a priest present and everything. They just recently got back from their honeymoon. This is sad! Look at what our world has become. People rather marry a computer character than actually communicate with real people. We must act quick, I don't know what will happen next. Finally, computer cost a lot of money. You pay @MONEY1 for the computer outright, but then you have all the up keep and there is lots of up keep. Computers are very troublesome. You just keep pouring money into it, which is just depressing. It will just break again soon or freeze and cause you to loose a report you've worked on all night. For example, @DATE1 my dad had to pay @MONEY2 in order to get my @DATE1 computer unbaked. He was so reluctant to even pay it and afterwards he was annoyed all week for even paying it. It got even worse when it froze up a week later. He was freaking out. Thats all you get from computers, more and more frustration. I just don't think it's worth it."
5,"Dear @ORGANIZATION2, @DATE1, computers are a big part of our society. They are an advance in technology, and they have some positive effects. However, computers have more negative effects on people. They take away and diminish @CAPS3 time, interacting with family, and seeing the world. First, computers have a negative effect on people because they diminish @CAPS3 time. People are so caught up with computers, their desire for @CAPS3 starts to fall. According to a @ORGANIZATION3 survey in @DATE2, for @CAPS1 person spending @NUM1 hours on the computer a week (roughly @NUM2 hours each day) had an increase in cholesterol and slowly deteriorating muscles. ""Computers distract people from their needs"" says @PERSON1 of @ORGANIZATION1. ""@CAPS1 person needs about one to two hours of physical activity each day, and only @NUM2 out of @NUM4 people get this amount."" The leading cause for this low number? ""technology,"" she says, ""@CAPS2 computers, which take away all of the motivation and time people need to @CAPS3."" @CAPS3 is vital, and computers are taking this away from society. People shouldn't have bad @ORGANIZATION1 because of this negative effect: computers. Second, computers have a negative effect on people because they deteriorate interaction with family. @NUM5 out of @NUM4 people say that computers take away from their family time, reports Family @CAPS4 @ORGANIZATION3. This is not of all good, especially since @CAPS1 person needs at least @NUM7 hours of interacting with family for an assured healthy mental state and being. Children are directly affected by computer use in family settings. When computer time starts to eat up time, it also cuts of communication, something extremely important in graving children. with this, family bonds and relationship are ruined as Wall. It affects interacting with family, and puts hates in family bonds: computers heaved negative effect on people. Lastly, computers have a negative effect on people because it takes away from people using their world. When you're on the computer, it seems like the entire world is in your computer screen. But its not. This is effecting people negatively. @PERCENT1 of people who use computers on the stocking average of about @NUM2 hours a day have noted become withdrawn and unaware of their world says my physcology.net. The cure? Traveling, or even talking Wallks to enjoy nature can help. People should be aware of their world in which they live. They have to make important designs for themselves, their children, even their country, and staring at a computer screen wont help at all. It especially will effect children, the next generation, who will have no knowledge or a clear view on the world if people keep up their negative habits: computer usage. In conclusion, computers have negative effects on people. They diminish @CAPS3, so bad @ORGANIZATION1 increases and the need for @CAPS3 increases. It cuts family interaction by destroying family relationships and bonds, not to mention communication. Finally, it takes away from people seeing the world, something actually very important because it affects people's decision making as well as future generations. People need to realize these bad effects, and majorly decrease their computer usage."
5,"Dear Local Newspaper, Computers have a positive effect on people. With a computer you could do so many things! They provide plenty of information, communication, and even entertainment. The only reason some find it to be unhealthy or negative is because some people abuse their ""computer time"". Ever used the popular website ww.google.com? Sites like this, and many more, are great when you need information. Your practically just type in a word and automatically have hundreds or thousands of links, containing information on that word, to choose from! How could so much knowledge be named unhealthy, or have a negative effect on people? Computers have dictionaries, references, translators, encyclopedias, or even history pages that hold massive information. So go ahead and expand your knowledge! If you log onto one of the most famous and well used social networking websites, such as @CAPS1 or @CAPS2, you will find a new way to communicate with friends and family. Equipped with tools and various settings to keep you safe, you can find long lost friends or outfought family members and instantly catch up. Again, many people abuse those websites, putting up harmful words, inappropriate things, but that problem can be easily solved if you ""report' them to the website manager or to an adult. You just have to know how to be safe online, if not, the computer can be a very negative object for you. If you know how to use it right, you'll enjoy messages from family or instant messages from friends. There is a wide variety of entertainment on your computer. From video sharing websites like www.youtube.com. to gaming websites like www.onemorelevel.com. These sites provide games and many videos, or even learning aids. There are sites wheee you can purchase music nag movies, or even clothes and furniture. Many stores have online websites whee you can purchase items and have them shipped to your front door. How could that possibly be regroup? Also, there are video games that are specially created for the computer, that you can buy, and have installed for instant entertainment. I mean, who doesn't like to play games or shop, without having to go through the trouble of finding time to go out and do it? I know my aunts do. So you see, computers aren't negative, unless you abuse your ""computer time"" and waste countless hours for no reason. You need to have a limit. Without it, it's just plain weird spending all day on a computer. So have fun! Learn, communicate, entertain you self."
5,"I remember when computer went so popular. Back then I had to write my essays and listen to music on the radio. Now computers are very popular. I believe that computers have positive effect on people @DATE1 because students need them for school, you can use them for other things, and lastly it is easy to aces them. You will know that computers are good for our society! Most students use the computers to type college essays, project etc. Which is good because its much easier. For example I'm a student that can't draw so printed some pictures of the computer so I can paste them on my post board. So in the other words the computer is useful for students. I know @NUM1 out of @NUM2 colleges expect students to turn in there assignments threw the computers or its a zero. In this society threes no tI'me for zeros because when you are in college your still paying for the class even if your failing or not. So basically its a waste of money. So the computer can save us from failing! People these days use computers for pleasure. Usually messaging people on MySpace, Facebook, twitter, and other social networks. Which is kind of inter sting because you can up with friend that you haven't seen in years. As you can see the internet has its advantages because you would have never thought you will see your friend doing. Another thing about computers that you can faint stuff cheaper than everyday LIFO say if you want to a trip and you call @ORGANIZATION1 for your ticket. The ticket came up to . But you go on the computer and you on @ORGANIZATION1 website and find your ticket to Florida the price will most likely be a couple hundred dollars less. Since we are in a rest ion we will need those couple hundred dollars for savings. Computers are everywhere You can find one at school, home, a cafe or even on your cell phone. Which is good because you can use them at your own convince. At home if my lab top is free I can go on it and be on it for hours playing games. Also, I remember when my computer broke and I wanted to go on the computer so badly. So I realized that I can go on the computer at the library. I was so happy because it was no cost to me. To sum up computers have a positive effect on people. I seriously don't know what to do if I didn't have one because students need them, you can do other things on it, and lastly its easy to aces one! In this generation everybody is rushing and computers."
5,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Which article title more interesting, ""Local @CAPS1 wins three mile race"" or ""Local @CAPS1 wins three mile race on computer game."" @CAPS3, the less interesting title is what your news will change to if people keep using computers. Some effects computers have on people use cheating an less time with family and friends and lastly, most people aren't learning anything while on the computer, they're just paling games. As you can see, I agree that computers are a bad idea. I bet some people have never thought of this but computers can lead kids, and maybe even adults, to cheating. There are websites on the internet where the user just types the question in, and they get an answer. There is @CAPS4 another way of cheating, copying others work, essays or articles form a website. Some students could be told to write a biography on a person, and they could just copy an article, switch some words around to make a sound like their own paper, and with no guilt. Another can people computer spend less time with family and friends I was watching television and playing on the computer. The wife was very close to because spent the computer helping @CAPS4, there can was always in the on the computers. Because this show I realized that computers kinds antisocial divorce between paren'ts go up. Do you see all people computers looking up facts about things as going on the computers learning. I know that when I have time to go on the computer, I am not looking up things to learn. Most people these days dint care too much about learning about countries, other than their own, or people, other than people they know. I think it's pretty obvious that no one is going on computers to learn, otherwise they wouldn't have so many users on game websites. In conclusion, computers have negative effects that get to all people. So, @ORGANIZATION1 you want to have your news be the latest divorces and computer game high scores? Or do you want interesting news that will keep you newspaper going. Thanks for taking the time to read this."
5,"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 has come to my attention that the aspect of computers and their influence on people has been brought up. I personally feel that computers are a marvelous tool to help mankind advance. They provide infinite knowledge, entertainment, and dispute what the opposing side says, allow social interactions for those who don'@CAPS4 like to meet face to face. My first reason why computers benefit humans rather than hurt them is the knowledge they provide. Computers give access to the internet, which has infantry amount of knowledge stored inside @CAPS2. With a simple click of a button you have thousands of websites dedicated to answering your question. They can provide tons of information normally unobtainable. Take for example two students, one with a computer are without. BOTh are given an assignment to write a report on a famous person. The one with the computer logs any searches for the reason, and in seconds has enough information to write numerous reports. He aces the reports, and continues to use this method. He graduates top of the class, goes through college and gets a high paying job right out of the gate. The one without the computer needs to go to the library. After spending an hour walking there, he learns that all the books on thetaa person are checked out. He finds a book with a short bit on that person and writes about thetaa. He fails the test, fails the grade, drops out of school, and works OT a @ORGANIZATION1 his entire life. See how much of a different a computer can make? My second reason is that, even though computers are often thought of as destroying @CAPS2, @CAPS3 can build social lives. Millions of people use the internet every time and there are places on the web built so that they can talk. Some people @MONTH1 that this is and leads to , but anyone who has basic knowledge knows nOT to information. The internet also has and those still unsure can use specially sites to talk to people they know in life only. @CAPS2 also allows for people to ask questions. Having differently finding specific information? Just post a question on a public site use people with first hand experience will answer @CAPS2 with all the detail you need and more. Say that somebody wants to be a writer, but needs to know how the writing system works, how to set a job in @CAPS2, what the pay is, etc. He searches the internet, but only finds job applications and college Day so he asks the questions on a public site. Someone who has been a write their whole lives checks out the question, and answers @CAPS2 ion great detail. Problem solely and @CAPS2 someone on the internet. My final reason is the entertainment computer provide you can play games, watch movies or homemade videos, and even talk to friends. Computers allow you to access thousands of free services to benefit you. Sitting in your room, bored? Why nOT play a game on your computer. Tired of @CAPS4.V movies? Go to the computer and have an infinite wide library? Go to the computer and have an infinite video library at your dipole. Lonely? Go to a social website and strike up a conversation. @CAPS2 has infinite entertainment, right at your fingertips. In conclusion, I believe that computers is no limit to what you can do with a computer, as long as you have the imagination. Computers were invented to benefit mankind, nOT hurting and they are doing a great job."
5,"@CAPS8 more and more technology is being invented, peoplee use the computer to do work and to learn. But more time on the computer is not necessarily a good thing. People do not exercise enough, strain their eyes, and have less interaction with real people"
5,"One evening, @CAPS1 I got home from school, I didn't know what I had for homework. I decided to call my friends cell phone, but instead I got her voice mail. I left her a voice mail and called her hoise phone instead, the same thing bad happened. Luckily, I had my other friends numbers I coild use. The next day, I asked her why she didn't pick her cell and hoise phone. She told me ""I'm sorry, I guess I was to busy on the computer emailing other people."" @CAPS1 I think of people being on the computer too much, I think they don't get en oight exercise, don't enjoy nature, and spend less time with family and friends. First @CAPS1 people spend too much time on the computer, they spend less time exercising. Aboit @PERCENT1 of people do this and it's not healthy. @CAPS2 people do this too often, then they will not get enoigh exercises and withoit excesses then they won't be healthy @CAPS1 they get older. @CAPS3 @PERSON1 said ""@CAPS2 adults spend too much time on the computer, maybe @NUM1 hoirs a day or more while eating junk food like chips and soda, they are not setting a good example for their kids. @CAPS2 adults get into this bad habit, so will their kids and it's to early for kids to be unhealthy."" I also agree with @CAPS3 @PERSON1, she is right aboit how people spend too much time on the computer. Second, @CAPS1 people are on their computer, its like their face is glued to the screen and they don't care aboit nature, @CAPS1 people do this, I can't stand it. Its like they don't care aboit anything else. What I don't get is why can't they go oitside and do something for at least a half hoir, then go back to the computer and waste their time then? Going oitside and enjoying nature is peaceful on a nice sunny clay. Yoi coild have a picnic, take a hike, or even hang oit with friends instead of playing on the computer. I understand @CAPS2 its a bad day like @CAPS2 its snowing or a thunderstorm and yoi can't do anything oitside, then yoi go on the computer. I think that at least @PERCENT2 of people woild try this. Third, @CAPS2 people are too busy on the computer then they won't be able to hung oit with friends or family. @CAPS2 yoir friends want to hang oit with yoi and they want to go to the mall. But yoi can't because yoir on the computer, she woild be furiois at yoi. Yoi picked the computer over yoir friends to go to the mall. There's probably a @PERCENT1 chance she won't ever talk to oi again. and I don't blame her. People who spend to much time on the computer, woild barely understand whats going on. @CAPS2 someone tells yoi something, it goes in one ear and oit the other. @CAPS1 people do this, its really disappointing because yoi dint hang oit as much as with yoir friends and family. As yoi can see, people are spending too much time on the computer than excising, enjoying nature, and spending time with family and friends. @CAPS2 yoi ask me, I don't play on the computer as much which is a good thing."
5,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, The use of advanced computers have increased. You don't see kids outside as often. On the news, you hear about obesity. And you hear the crime rates go up. This does not benefit the society. Computers has a negative effect on people. Does your neighborhood seem to be locking children? It's not because their dead! They are now always inside on their computer. I know a thirteen year old named @ORGANIZATION1. She even admits that being on a computer is better than being outside with friends. Meeting people over technology, especially for miners, is a huge risk. You don't know the person. Soon, you would have no friends when it comes to being in the social life. You'd be the outsider. For @PERSON3, her family doesn't even know who she is anymore. Do you want your child to be the outsider? Being on a computer all the time is like being at a fast food restaurant. You don't exercise, all you do is eat Andy talk, but now all you do is eat and on the computer. I have met a obese child. @PERSON2. He weighs three hundred pounds at the age fourteen. An eight grader, can you believe that? He tells me he has his laptop on his lap, surround er by junk food. He never exercises or take a break. His report card is unbelievable. He used to be A @CAPS3 student. Now he's in a dump. @PERSON2 does not listen to his mom at all. @PERSON1, @ORGANIZATION2's, mom says ""he locks himself in his room, goes straight to his laptop, and starts eating. You can even hear him munching the junk food."" And we wonder why our kids are getting obese there days. It used to be about jobs, but now it's about who you meet on a computer. Myspace, Facebook, twitter, you name it, is how the crime rates are increasing now. The people behind these pictures and profiles @MONTH1 not be who you think they are. Especially, miners who lie about their age. They're the ones who fall for those perverted old men. That is one way our sex offenders get a way around. They can use someone's name and be under over. They tell these young girls to meet them places and that's how our young girls, and boys, gets kidnapped, rapped, and end up killed. A computer holds millions of ways criminals can commit a crime. Do you want your child to be next? Computers these days, are used in the wrong ways, by the wrong people. Kids are never outside again. They are getting obese. And it's a way they get kidnapped. Don't allow this. Get your child(ren) away from their laptops now! Go on a family vacation, somewhere fun. And don't let these sick minded people get to you or your kids. Take action now!"
5,"Dear @CAPS1, Computers have really made an impact on society. Some people, think they have made a good impact while others think the opposite. I believe that they are a good thing in our lives and have made a drastic, but great impact. Some reasons that support my opinion are that computers are basically what helps us keep in touch with people, they make it very easy to find needed information and they make our school lives faster and much simpler. First of all, computers are pretty much how people keep in touch. There are many ways you can keep in touch over computers. Tere is video chatting, email and chat websites such as @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4 etc. There are many people that really enjoy having the ability to keep in touch this way. It is a step up from talking on the phone. On the computer if you are web chatting, you can not only talk to them, but you can see them! When it comes to chatting websites such as @CAPS2, there are millions of people who belong to this incredible website and love it. Kids and adults really enjoy having access to something like this. For me, since I moved to @STATE1 and had to leave all my friends behind, the computers has saved some of my relationships that I thought I would lose but didn't want to. I can email my friends, and even see what they look like and how much they have changed on @CAPS2. Computers are a very helpful piece of technology that have helped me, and so many other people keep in touch. Another important reason computers are a wonderful technology item is because they make it so easy to find needed information. From what a word means, to the directions to get to @LOCATION1, the computer can help with all of this. I talked to my mom and she said. ""Computers just make @CAPS6 all of the information I need to knew about your brother's diabetes so easy."" @CAPS6 information in books can take so long. You have to go to the library or a bookstore, find the book you need with the correct information, and then you have to read through the whole book to find the information needed. On a computer, you can just Google what you need to find, and read the article or map, etc. Computers have made @CAPS6 information a breeze and everyone loves how simple it is! The last reason that supports my opinion is that computers make our school lives faster and much simpler to deal with. In school, there are times when we need to write a very lengthy composition, and it will take forever to write. With a computer, typing up the composition would probably take around half the time of writing the composition. I took a survey of three kids that typed a composition and three kids that wrote it. I asked each of the kids how long it took them. The kids that wrote the paper said it took them around two hours. The kids that typed the composition said it took them around an hour. Also, when things are typed, they are usually easier to read which makes it easier for teachers to grade, and won't take as long. Computers make school easier for students and teachers. The opinion that computers are not a benefit to society just doesn't make sense. Yes, I know that there can be some disadvantages. But think of all the advantages compared to the disadvantages. There are a lot more good than bad things. Without computers, people would be incredibly stressed, and have a hard time making life easier. Computers are an amazing benefit to society. Everyone should agree with this because people stay in touch because of computers, computers make it very easy to find information that needed, and they make our school lives ain't easier and faster for students and teachers. Computers have made an extremely large impact and changed our ways of life for the better!"
5,"Dear @LOCATION2, @CAPS1 your workers wake up in the @TIME1, they stretch their right muscles and put on their pizza slippers. They wonder down the hail way and open their @CAPS2 book air to check the weather for today. They go on @ORGANIZATION1, @NUM1, and etc. to view their emails sent from work friends, and family. They check the time on the boo tom of the laptop screen and lag onto to play some they are getting ready. Society today relies heavily on computers and the net work their keeps us all connected... the incorrect with technological advances happening today, people are now using computers to help with their work. But is that a some @MONTH1 say that it is due to the fact the amount of spent on the computer is the much and that it stop from with friends but it does computers help with the skill of typing, help with fast end easy and helps friends and @NUM2. of through @NUM2 @CAPS3, @CAPS4, etc I believe that computers have a positive affect on people and once a great addition to society. to begin, computers help to reach @CAPS6, children, and even adults the skill of typing. Statistics show that more and more jobs on computers and hire people with a higher words per minute ability with almost @PERCENT1 of adopting new computer and using computers to store information to their company, computers are necessity and so is the knowledge of understanding computers and being able to type. Moreover, @CAPS6 these days are depending on computers for research to order to do projects and information I can personally connect to this because being a student on @LOCATION1 school, I am assigned project what involve typed words and or information. how hand it would I had to hand writs all of my work and on the for information. @CAPS1 multiple @CAPS6 are assigned the same project, the does not mill on @CAPS6 to check looks out @CAPS5 there was no computer to use, what would I do? for @CAPS6, computers and a great thing. Furthermore, @CAPS6 and even adults enjoy social time, but @CAPS1 friends are family line faraway or you are not able to visit three, the computer connect in handy computer help to keep friends and family connected through @CAPS3, @CAPS8, @ORGANIZATION1 / or @NUM1, I.M / @PERSON1, and web cam video chats. All of those computer related things would not there for @CAPS5 there were no computer. Would you want no be disconnected from family and being social is a key part of being You why shouldn't we keep them and why with all of these positive things about computer would ever make you doubt them? In computers are wonderful things. They he is to build skill of typing, help and it easy, and also help keep and family connected. Computers affect people only good ways and help ever day life be easy. so, believe that computers are a great thing and that without them, even just talking to family could be jeopardized. Lets keep computers"
5,"Dear Newspaper, Have you notice that now a days more and more people are becoming overweight? Well its true. People say that it is because of eat a lot of fast food but I think that since we are always on the computer and not excising helps contribute to it. Also as the technology is getting better it is keeping people from going outside and enjoying the beautiful nature. Sitting in front of the computer isn't going to help our environment. Lastly, kids aren't getting out of their house to interact with friends and family because technology has been able to let us communicate without leaving our house. @CAPS1 not saying that we should downgrade our technology, but we need to find a way limit it. To start on with, technology has a role in the increasing rate of obesity. Some @MONTH1 say that people chose not to ex cerise but if we limit things then they won't have to chose. As a kid myself, I love to be on the computer. My paren'ts are always trying to get the computer and take the dogs for a walk and I always say ""@CAPS1 busy"" @CAPS2 its true, I don't really like to go outside because I have a computer to play games or talk to friends and to be honest excising to me seems important but I don't do it because I'm always on the computer. I think that other people could feel this way so that's why we need to limit the computer. Secondly, global warming is occurring right now and people would rather be inside on the computer then go outside and enjoy the nature. @CAPS2, you @MONTH1 be able to look up ways to stop global warming, but does it mean you are going to really do it? Some @MONTH1 not because they could just stay on the computer and keep ""@CAPS3 up"" ways to help another things is that when we use our computers, we use electricity, which adds to global warming so it we limit the use of computers then people could go enjoy nature and not destroy it. Lastly, internet sites like MySpace, @CAPS4, @CAPS5, etc have allowed us to communicate with friends and family but we are still not able to get out and interact with them. When we get out and interact with our friends we gain like communication teamwork and respect friend and family can teach you this with them the computer they can't. Also interacting with your family and friend @MONTH1 let you go in new places that you haven't been before and on the computer you can't go there. Interacting with friends & family is better than talk Thur the computer. In conclusion if we stay on the computer then we won't get ex cerise enjoy nature or interact with friends. So we need to act now limit compute usage!"
5,"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I think that people spend way too much time on the computer these days. They get less exercise. Don't get to enjoy the nature aroind them, and they don't get to interact with their family and friends! If people stop spending so much of their day on the computer, then they woildn't be having too many issues. People need to spend less time on computers, and spending more time exercising! Computers all over the world do not involve much interaction with any part of yoir body other than yoir hands. Yoi don't tend to want to get up or do anything else when yoi're on yoir computer, right? Well that needs to change. Often, people get cranky while they are using a computer or if they need to get off of one. Some people are so obsessed, they might even break down and have a fit! Nobody want's to see someone throw a fit because they have to get off the computer do they? If they don't get exercise anytime when yoi're not on a computer it can definitely shows. Jimmy @CAPS2 says, ""@CAPS3 @NUM1 kids are on their computers way to much! They never come oit of their rooms, and if they ever do, then they are normally very cranky. They're getting fat! I can tell because all they eat is junk food. This needs to "" @CAPS4 can't even have a little of time with his children. They shoild go on a family trip and enjoy together! That brings us in next issue. We all need to enjoy nature more. Why woild yoi spend yoir time on a computer looking of pictures of nature when yoi have it right there in yoir . It's because kids are too lazy to get off their lazy and go oitside. The best thing aboit nature is that if yoi are  aboit need to be alone or even just need to get , nature is always there for yoi anytime yoi need it. Yoi can la ways go oitside with yoir friends and family too!. I'm sure that they woild appreciate people getting off their computers to spend some quality time together. Yet again, oir next and final issue. Computer obsessed teenagers and adults need to be with their family and friends. When talking to yoir friends why bother talking to them on the computer when yoi can just get together and go do something fun? ALso, when yoi spend time with yoir family, it brings them a lot closer toy oi. Nobody likes to not talk to the people yoi love and the people who reused yoi. When yoi're on a computer I just think of all the places yoi coild , place yoi coild be with. Nobody wants to be distant from their friends and family. Therefore, people shoild turn off their computers, go exercise, be aroind nature and have some quality time with their friends and family. Thank yoi"
5,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, The effects computers have on people can be hurting our society or it can also be helping society. As a middle schools growing up, I believe using computers can be beneficial at same point but it is also damaging our society. First of all, the internet is full of inappropriate content. Illegal uses are involved and can draw in anyone with just s single click of a mouse. Anyone in the world can use the technology we have today to ""hack"" or tress pass someone else's computer. Anybody can download songs or documents illegally for free, rather than paying for it themselves. In fact, not only can someone download inappropriate content right onto their screen, they can also be inflicted upon with graphic words or view a website that involves videos with drug use. criminal acts, vulgar language and more. A recent study on internet use from the @ORGANIZATION1 for internet use includes that ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5"" has a history of a result to suicides or depression in teens. @CAPS4 @CAPS5 is a form of @CAPS5 where someone can chat or instant message someone and hurt their feelings. Not only is @CAPS4 @CAPS5 an issue, however, people can now talk to strangers on the internet. Think about how awful it would be if your child had given out their private information online and a man who said they were the same age as your child received it and lied about their age, sex, appearance, and age. Now that man can track your child down and possibly kidnap or hurt them. Secondly, the internet can also be very unhealthy and can create you to become less social. According to @CAPS7 @CAPS8 at @ORGANIZATION2, @PERCENT1 of children or teenagers that result to internet use can create a weak relationship with friends and family members if they use the computer too much. It can be very unhealthy for someone, and not just teenagers, to use the computer for an extended amount of time than they should. People can gain the effects of laziness, little brain effort, and lose interaction with the outside world. Finally, my foremost reason on how computers can be negative is how addicting it can be. From my own experience, I used to stay up late for hours using websites such as @CAPS9 because everyone else was using it. Sure, it can be entertaining and fun but using the internet won't be so much ""fun"" when your academic grades are at risk and you stop communicating with the outside world. Adiction can draw anyone in against their willpower. My own brother became so addicted to computer games that he played one game straight for @NUM1 hours straight. You can get addicted to one subject until you lose everything else you have. The internet can be great in moderation, however it can be inn appropriate, unhealthy, and addicting. If technology becomes too powerful in our civilization, how can we learn to interact with our humanity. More and more Pele become involved with technology and frankly it can be quite horrendous in my opinion."
5,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, The question is close too much computer time cause people to interact less with their surroundings? In my opinion, no computers definitely don't make people lazy and less interactive with others arid them. First, I think that computers can sometimes make you smarter. I mean you can read about history, world news and you can research many different topics. I remember when I was younger I would love to learn about the @CAPS1. I use to search it all the time and I made a poster project for fun. Thanks to the computer I got accurate information. A survey conducted by the @CAPS2 school social studies teacher shows that @PERCENT1 of their students used the computers to find facts for school projects. @PERCENT2 out of that @PERCENT1 end up getting better grades. Famous psychologist @PERSON2 says that ""kids and students learn more when they are on the computer researching or @CAPS7 new things."" I know you @MONTH1 be thinking that too much internet is unhealthy for people but mostly students. But at @ORGANIZATION1 it a good source of @CAPS7 for them. Therefore the computer helps teach everyone facts and many stays on whats going on around the world. Second, people can interact with family and friends online. i mean there's @CAPS3 where people can socialize with their families who live out of state. I remember when I was in @NUM1 grade I made a new friend and she moves to @LOCATION1 in the @DATE1 after @NUM2 grade. I keep in touch with her on @CAPS3. A survey conducted by student council at that @PERCENT3 of students had someone they know and love move away out of state @PERCENT4 out of ta ht @PERCENT3 keep in touch by email or @CAPS3. Famous scientist @ORGANIZATION2 says, ""People who keep in touch with family and friends tend to stay happy and not become depressed."" I know you @MONTH1 be thinking that people don't need to keep in touch with their families all the time but it makes them happier. Therefore people need computers so they can keep in touch with their families. Third, you can learn new exercise, moves or tricks. I mean you can do new exercise, train for dance competition or learn new magic tricks for you magic show. I remember when I wanted to learn how to twirl a baling between my fingers I went and found a video of someone teaching step by step on how to do it. its easier now. A survey conducted by @CAPS5 muscles @CAPS6 shows that @PERCENT5 of their @CAPS6 members get stronger and more fit by @CAPS7 new exercises. Famous athlete @PERSON1 says ""@CAPS7 new exercises online helps me stay fit for my games"". I know you @MONTH1 be thinking ta ht they can just go to someone to teach them BUT no one wants to pay money for something you can get free online. Therefore, @CAPS7 new exercises, moves or tricks online can help them out a lot. To conclude, does too much computer time cause people to interact less with their surroundings? No, it helps them learn, socialize with family and friends and they can get in shape with the new exercise that they learn from how to videos."
5,"Dear @PERSON1, @CAPS1 in your newspaper, I read an article that sparked my interest. The article was about the negative effects computers have on the community. I couldn't help but disagree with the article, @PERSON1 because, in my opinion, computers are a step in the right direction for modern technology. I believe computers are a benefit to society because they pr emote hand eye coordination, you can learn about almost anything, and you can talk online to other people. How do computers help with hand eye coordination, you ask? When you are typing on the computer your eyes are on the screen while your hands are typing and strengthening at an incredible rate! A study made by students at @ORGANIZATION1 shows that the chances of developing arthritis by the time you are @NUM1 dropped almost @PERCENT1 in people that use computers often. Also, the hand eye coordination you get from typing, goes a long way in sports such as tennis and baseball. So if someone needs to build up their hand eye coordination I suggest that they take a computer class, like the ones that are offered in many schools all over the country. Secondly, using the internet on computers makes finding information on a variety of subjects much easier. Say you wanted to go on vacation with your family. Instead of calling a number, why not go online and plan your entire trip from your computer. There are so many websites that make it fast and easy. In addition, sites can teaching people how to clot hings are always nearby. If you wanted to learn how to knit, just type in ""how to knit"" in your favorite search engine and there are over @NUM2 sites to help you, making it easy to learn to make a great or fix a bike. In addition to learning about new things the internet allows you to friends. After camp, I would always say ""oh we will keep in touch,"" but I never would be able to keep any promise. Once I found an instant mes sager or web cam application on the internet, it was very easy to talk to my friends. Every once in a while I talk to my friend who now lives in @LOCATION1! Also, my dad is always stressed about meetings with other countries, but now that he can use web cams to talk to his other international bosses, he is so excited about his meetings. He always says that the computers nowadays are very easy to use for talking to people. In conclusion, I believe that computers are a benefit to the world because they help with hand eye coordination, make it easy to get information, and talk to people."
5,"Dear NewsPaper @CAPS1, Have you ever taken into consideration how much an effect technology has on our society? Well, for numerous people, computers are their lives. They help adults stay in contact with their friends. Also, it gives users use full information about anything you can think of. Computers are a great tool to help us with our lives, they help us learn skills for later in life. People who use computers do not spend too much time on them, we need them to live a good life. For example, the internet has many websites that keep people in touch. There are countless sites and to name a few, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @ORGANIZATION1, the list goes on and on. Many adults begin to realize that childhood friends seem to fade away as time goes on. With computers, you can chat with each other all night. In @CAPS4, it is also a convenient way to contact friends if they live in different places around the @LOCATION1. Moreover, computers are chock full of information. If a family wanted to take a vacation, they could use the computer to find a place they would enjoy and book a flight there. Also, if a student needed to do a report and was not able to go to the library, he/she would be able to use the computer to get the info for the report. Lastly if someone had an ailment and didn't know it was serious enough for a visit to the doctors office, they could look it up on the internet. they also have many sites for that sole purpose such as @ORGANIZATION2. Lastly, computer users learn valuable skills that these who don't will never have. Just knowing how to work one is an important skill but there are many features computers have that will help when a job or in college. For instance, making a power point for jobs or just slide shows of a party in your back yard. In @CAPS4 , typing is a valuable skill that most jobs nowadays require. And using the computer fine tunes hand eye coordination. Although some @MONTH1 say that staring at a screen all day isn't healthy, @CAPS5 of @CAPS6.S.A citizens say using the computer is healthy for their social lives and we should use it in moderation. Computers are amazing tools if used properly and in moderation. The time has come to tell the people computers are use full to society. They help social lives, teach us skills and, give us information on countless topics. People need them to have an enjoyable life. So, write an article regarding the need for the use of computers @DATE1 and notify the people they are making the right decision by using them. "
5,"@CAPS1 you want people to be over weight? @CAPS1 you Watt our beautiful out doors to be ruined? And @CAPS1 you want family's to be distant because they are to pare @CAPS2? Statistics show that @PERCENT2 of family's dint talk because they are to pareocupied wit"
5,"Many people debate on whether on net computers have negative effects on them @CAPS1 believe have negative effects on them @CAPS1 believe computers are an asset to society because you can access almost anything. That is the problem. The content on computers is afflicted upon everyone that sees it, Computers also don't help people get healthier, AFN if you need to research something books are more help than the internet. For starter, the contents on computers and the internet are too much for people and society. @CAPS4 I'm saying is way too much can be accessed on the internet. Derrogatory and pornographic websites harm people the @CAPS1 especially @ORGANIZATION1 and teens. Chinese government officials have cut off access to the @CAPS1 dangerous websites. Chinese readers started ""@CAPS3 be live the things that are easily accessed on computers are poisoning the minds of the youth."" The internet and computers are  waiting to explode and invade the minds of everybody. Secondly, computers aren't me tally from computers but physically unstable also. Computers offer of games for @ORGANIZATION1 to play. These games start off fun but they become habits. Don't get me away though games can be fun but when a child plays a game for hours a day there is a problem. The problem is that kids are not getting enough of the exercise they need. Studies performed by the @ORGANIZATION1  know that @PERCENT1 of child who play computer generated games are overweight. Therefore I believe games are harmful habit to young @ORGANIZATION1. Lastly, many people do research on the internet. but some facts are actually @CAPS4 I'm getting is that no one need a computer to look up or do research on projects. Instead go to a library. Many find books boring but it will help in the long . I remember a tI'me when i had a project Durer for @PERSON1's in @NUM1 grade on @LOCATION1. I looked up information on the internet instead of using a book just to learn that the facts were actually highly in accurate . Therefore, never depend on the internet as a source of research. from derogatory content, to unhealthy youth, to inaccurate research. Computers are not assets to society but issues. In my opinion i believe computers are actually doing more harm than good to ever body that uses them."
5,"@ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1 you imagine the kids in schools that you yourself run not being able to research on computers? Would you be okay with kids not having the option @ORGANIZATION3 typing their homework? Do you think the adolescence @ORGANIZATION3 @LOCA"
5,"Dear State legislator, @CAPS1 you live back a long time ago when there were no computers. The only difference now is the technology is there but you are not allowed to use it. Do you think your job would be harder. I diffidently think that computers are making your job and everyone Elise's life's easier. With the computer it teaches hand eye coordination, gives people the ability to learn about far away places, and it gives people the ability to talk to each other. I be live the @CAPS4 technology of the computer is diffidently helping out society. To start, computers are helping many people with their hand eye coordination. As you know hand eye coordination is miscarry for a good driver. The @CAPS4 statistics that came out from @CAPS2 drivers.com the rate of accidents has decreased over the past ten years. In fact it decreased over @PERCENT1. With all the computer games that they have for young kids it is improving kids hand eye coordination. Starting at a young age. With the games like @CAPS3 a majority of kids are ridding bikes skiing or snow boarding by five years old. All of these activities require very good hand eye coordination. Lastly , the resources that help with hand eye coordination are being used to help special ed students get better at simple tasks at a faster parse. Secondly the world wide web is teaching people of all ages about places that are located thousands of miles away from their homes. Something that I personally use my computer for is to research a location and find history on it before I go on vacation to that place. The computers in our school has helped our classes in social studies. My teacher @PERSON1 said that he has been grading more strictly often and the grades are still up by @PERCENT2 on computer and internet research projects. I should also add in that using the computers our school is in communication with a school in @LOCATION1. Once a week we email our pen pa. the computers have diffidently helped my schools curriculum. Finally, computers are letting people of all ages talk to business partners, friends etc. The social networking sites have kept @PERCENT3 of friends in touch found in @CAPS4tech magazine. I should also add in it has reconnected @PERCENT4 of friends from high school all due to the computer. Another form of online talking is video chatting which many people are now using for business meetings instead of spending the money to fly to the location of their meeting. Now, for one day you should track how many hours you are on the computer for your job. I can bet the number is going to be about @PERCENT5 of the time you are in you office. The computers have with hand eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about places far away from home, and lets people talk to each other online. So do me a favor state legislator realize and come to terms how much society needs the computer."
5,"Dear Local newspaper, @CAPS1 you have a computer at home you enjoy? Computers are a big thing now in life, they help with many things. Such as staying organized, studies, and even entertainment. These are the three topics I will focus on, because I @CAPS1 believe that computers are useful and people use them a help to make life a lot more easy. Let me start by saying: ""I am a man who enjoys computers, as a way to talk to friends, listen and search music, watch videos on YouTube, get school work done, and much more! Although, on main point is it helps me stay organized. I can make many folders to store my work in, rather then losing or spilling something on the paper if I wrote it out. I can have my music, homework, projects, does work, videos, pictures, and much more saved and organized so I know where it is every time I go to find it. There can be no more, ""my dog ate my homework"" excuse. Moving on to the next topic. As I mentioned you can save work onto your computer, you can add without erasing as well, the work becomes neat and perfect every time. So when you teacher is grading on neatness no worry. You can also look up information on any topic you are working on in class witch allows you to get. More information, the better the grade. Spelling is not a factor now, because your computer tells you when a word is splat wrong. It even gives you suggestions on how to spell the word by underlining it with a red squiggle line. This really helps because a lot of people have hard times with spelling. You can even get @CAPS2 to play a book you are reading, witch helps you learn new words that you @MONTH1 not have knew how to sound out. Teachers can even post notes on school websites of homework, when projects are @CAPS1, ext. No more, ""I didn't know/remember what was homework/project due. Lastly, entertainment is the biggest thing with computers. People go on every day uploading videos, pictures, blogs, and just about what ever they want. Games are played on computers by younger kids, just learning, while older kids are enjoying playing maze, driving, shooting, adventure, and much more types of games. Just about everyone using a computer knows of some chat website in witch they use to communicate with any one. Myspace, Facebook, twitter, and so much more are used by people to talk, express how they feel to everyone/to just let it out), show love to someone, send birthday wishes, to @CAPS1 what ever. Those are endless possibilities at entertainment on a computer. Without a doubt, no more, ""I'm bored"". @CAPS1 you use your computer to @CAPS1 anything like this? If so you must enjoy it. People use computer for every thing from work to expressing feelings. Now what side are you at?"
5,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 years computers didn't exist, but now many people are having internet in their homes. But to some, the effect its giving on the people is negative. However, I believe that computers have a positive effect on people in many ways. Such as, the internet allows people to keep in touch, gives them technology skills to prepare them @CAPS1 more hi tech jobs; and allows them to find and learn about new things. Dont you think computers help society? People live in all parts of the world, and those that are lucky get to meet a lot of people from different places in the country. But, you can't talk on the phone due to long distance calls; so with a computer people don't have to lose touch! Its quite easy @CAPS1 people to talk with others from anywhere without having to actually see them. Computers are an easy way to stay in touch with family, too. Therefore, people can talk to their distant relatives from all over when you don't even have to go visit them. Having a computer helps people to keep distant friends and family close in touch. Lets face it, the world is relying more and more on technology and computers. But, if young people start using computers sooner then in life it will make it easier to get a better job. Lots of jobs ask @CAPS1 technological skills in order to be hired; so having a computer when younger automatically prepares young adults @CAPS1 life. Besides that, there is a computer in just about every work place that is updated; restaurants, hotels, retail stores. and even in construction business. Nevertheless, computer skills aren't just a good skill to have; they are a necessary skill. Last, Computers are a faster and easier way to find new things and learn more about different topics. Instead of looking through various books and encyclopedias @CAPS1 researching, why not search the topic? Although, the computer and internet shouldn't completely replace books, it is a valuable researching tool. Someone that has never been to the pyramids could easily just research the pyramids and see amazing pictures, ancient history on them, and learn so much. Computers can help you learn so much about the world without having to leave your house. Now is the time to make your decision on whether or not you think computers are giving a positive effect on people. @CAPS1 the reasons of keeping in touch, giving"
5,"Computers can take a lot of a person's time, but there are also benefits to having one. You could gain loads of knowledge and make interaction with others easier with a click of the cursor. The computer is the smartest thing you ll ever see. All the facts of life and the world are put into it. Think of all the knowledge you would have from reading articles you find on google.com and all the other search engines. Wondering what is the best way to get somewhere? You can also look at maps of the whole world and zoom all the way to birds eye view. There's your map with just a click of the cursor. Does your child have a question from school that even you can't answer? There are help sites that can show and explain how to do your homework. Or if your child doesn't know what the homework and their friends are busy and can't tell them, most schools have websites with information about everything in school. There's your child's grades with just a click of the cursor. Your late for a party and you don't have a cell phone, but your family has one computer and you know your friend will be on. You can just log on to your Facebook, twitter, or MySpace and tell them your running late. It's @DATE1, no one writes letters anymore; there's email and instant messaging. Letters take forever to write and if you mess up you have to start over. When you type, all you do is hit ""backspace"" and you write over only your mistake. Letters also take forever to receive, while instant messages come, well, instantly! Haven't seen your cousin or just want to see them? Computers are being made with web cams, or you can simply buy a detached one. You could be talking with your friend and seeing them right on your computer just with a click of the cursor. Don't think that's enough? If you explored the computer, then you'd find it can help you with a lot more than just learning and interaction."
5,"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 the men and women who write everyday for a living, I would like @CAPS2 you were to write reaction on computers. They teach @LOCATION3 faraway places, help build hand eye coordination, and let @LOCATION3 talk online. Computers are part of everyday life and needs to be told about. First, computer let @LOCATION3 learn about faraway places without leaving the rooms. One of my mom's friends, They decide to move to @LOCATION2 she didn't like computer so didn't look at @LOCATION2's laws saying, I'll find out when I got there. ""@CAPS2 did find out the laws she didn't find enough cause cause she was arrested multiple times in her first few years. A few month es after her last arrest she came back to the @LOCATION3 where she could deal with the laws. @LOCATION2 is a beautifully country and all of arrests were accidents because she didn't know the laws. Ten minutes on computer searching the laws in @LOCATION2 could have kept her in @LOCATION1. Next, computers improve hand eye coordination. From a survey @PERCENT1 of children that spend more time on computers are better at tennis, and at baseball then others. @PERSON3, a gym teacher at the @ORGANIZATION2 says, ""@CAPS3 of these kids that spend time on the computer are weak and need to get some exercise.Dear local new paper: @CAPS1 you being the local newspaper, you have the power to say how you feel about the effects computers give to people. I believe that computers give great effects to people because it teaches hand eye coordination, gives people the ability to learn about far away places, and it allows you to talk to people. In all, @PERCENT2 of people agree with my idea about computers. Firstly, using computers teaches people about hand eye coordination. For example, my grandmother told me that she knows how to use her hands and eyes well because of using the computer. This is because she types and researches information all day long. In all, computers are designed to help your eyes and hands to focus more. Secondly, computers have a lot of interesting information on faraway places. @PERSON2 from @ORGANIZATION1 quotes, ""I always use computers for my work because it helps me learn about many new things. @CAPS5, it lets my wife and I search details about a trip we want to go on."" @CAPS5, the people agree with what @PERSON2 stated. However, people @MONTH1 say that computers give the wrong information many times, but @CAPS2 you find a wonderful website, it will never lie to you. Thirly, @CAPS2 you use computers it will let you talk online or video chat with friends or family all over the world. How this benefits you is because @CAPS2 you have not seen your relatives in ages and you cannot buy a ticket to visit them, then video chat. It has gotten people so much closer and you see the world in a whole different way. @CAPS5, instead of wasting all your cell phone minutes, go buy a laptop or computer with a camera on it so you can video chat. Lastly, taking to people and being active in other peoples life is important. In conclusion, you will have great eye coordination, you will be able to research faraway places, and you will always be allowed to video chat or talk to family online. @CAPS5, I want you to tell the whole world that computers are useful and people use them everyday without a problem. Lastly, you will have the best feeling ever @CAPS2 you make everyone smile by knowing you believe that spending time on the computer can teach you a lot! From so many students having greater hand eye coordination they will enjoy what their good at like tennis. @PERSON1, a professor of the human body at @ORGANIZATION1 states ""Technology helps hand eye. Many who use computers more than others to be greater at @CAPS6 @CAPS7 and games along those lines."" This shows how hand eye and exercise is linked to computer. Furthermore, computers help @LOCATION3 talk with other people. When a child goes to college they will still be able to email their families and talk to them. Talking with others by computers makes the world go round. World business need computers to contact each other to DECs plans on how to move toward economical. Lastly, computers are useful and should be useful more. They teach @LOCATION3 of faraway places, improve hand eye coordination, and let @LOCATION3 talk to other people. @CAPS2 an article is made to show the pros or computers, more people will experience the wonders of them."
5,"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 your computer daily can be a waste of your life. Your computer time can take away from your time spent exercising and enjoying nature, distract you from human nature things such as communicating, and can also waste tons of energy. Picture yourself, sitting at your desk, talking to some friends online. Take away your computer and all you re doing is sitting there, not burning one calorie, or exercising one muscle, expect your fingers of  @CAPS2't you think you should be doing something more use full in your life? Such as taking a walk and enjoying nature? That's what I thought. Nature is beautiful. So @CAPS4 enjoy it through h a window next to your desk? obesity is a problem in @LOCATION1. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 are considered ""fat"" @CAPS4 would you even think about spending your day simply sitting in a chair? Go to the gym and loose some of that extra body weight! Communicating throughh @CAPS5's is so overrated, people can't express their emotions! all they can do is send a smiley face or happy face. Communication WI only your friends can cause you to miss out on things. For example, lets say there is a cancellation at your work place on the news, but you @CAPS2't see it cause you were @CAPS6ing with your friend. @CAPS6? @PERCENT2 of people @CAPS2't even ""laugh out loud"" @CAPS7 they send that to their friends. Plus you @MONTH1 even go to your friends, house and instead of laughing, you'l say @CAPS6. Are instead of gasping, you say, ""@CAPS9!"" I mean come on people, get out and really ""communicate"" @CAPS10, so you bought one of those new lights? Too bad you re not even saving any energy by @CAPS1 that computer of yours daily. @CAPS1 that @CAPS11, uses about the same amount of energy in as @NUM1 regular light bulbs in @NUM2 hours, @CAPS12 that light really saving you that much money. Haven't you heard? the economy is bad, which means we @CAPS2't have alto of money which means YOU playing online games is wasting energy, which is wasting money. Someones going to have to work overtime this week, and it's not me. I @CAPS2't think hair spray is the cause of the layer being destroyed... Computers are bad, and dint have a good enough reason to be used. They take enjoying nature, red use your communication levels, and not to mention, waste a lot of energy. Therefore, my point is made."
6,"Dear @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 a teenager growing up in this techno logic era @MONEY1 society, I think computers are more harmful than helpful. I presume that books are better resources, people can find fun in other ways and that computers can be dangerous and cause health problems. @CAPS1 a well read newspaper, your stand on this subject will influence the minds @MONEY1 many. I know computers can help find information, but personally, I believe that books are better resources. Anyone can write and post an article on the internet, even if what they are saying is not true at all. People can lie and say they are a doctor in their @NUM1's when they are really a @NUM2 year old working at @ORGANIZATION1. On the computer, you can never be sure who to believe, but with books you know what you're reading is accurate. The information on the computer, (that's true) you can find a book. Sure, the computer @MONTH1 be the quicker or ""easy way @CAPS6 "" in some cases, but maybe what people need is a challenge. It seems that because @MONEY1 the growing technology, every generation gets lazier and lazier, and less and less into books and it's time for that to stop. Also, people can find fun in many other ways not involving a computer. Many people use social networking sites to connect with their friends, such @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 and @CAPS4, but on those, you can't tell if that person is really who they say they are or not. If you want to talk to your friends, why not call them or more modernly, text them? That way you can be sure @MONEY1 who you are talking to. Too many teens nowadays hide @CAPS6 in their rooms and play games on their computers and spend less and less time with their families. What hap pend to playing cards and board games with your family? It's much more enjoyable, in my opinion if you play the game for real and not virtually. You can also go outside and get some fresh air, instead @MONEY1 that muggy smell in your room because you're so busy on the computer, you forgot to @CAPS5 the laundry. Plus, if kids have to start handwriting their papers that would improve their handwriting, because they wouldn't get the simplicity @MONEY1 typing. Besides, some kids don't have access to computers, anyways and you have to hand write your @ORGANIZATION2's, so why not? Lastly computers can be dangerous and/or harmful to health. The use @MONEY1 social networks allows kids to put all their information @CAPS6 there, for anyone to see. This can lead to bad things, like being stalked or kidnapped. The internet also carries many inappropriate images and websites, that youngsters, or anybody, really, should be looking at also staring at a computer screen for hours on end is very bad for your eyes and can cause very serious vision problems in the long run. Plus, I'm sure you've heard how many typists are more prone to arthritis or any problems with pain or loss @MONEY1 the use @MONEY1 their fingers because @MONEY1 the movement @MONEY1 your fingers when you are typing. Getting RIF @MONEY1 computers will help to impact peoples' well being in a positive manner. While many people enjoy the use @MONEY1 computers, there is really not that great @MONEY1 a need for them. Books are better resources, you can find fun in many other ways, and they can be dangerous/harmful to health. Why spend hundreds or @MONEY1 on a tool that is not even necessary? Don't let the media fool you or pull you in with their tricks, scams, or gimmicks to get you buy one, and next time you go to turn on your computers, thinks "" @CAPS5 I really need this or is there a better way to achieve what I need to get done or what I want to @CAPS5?"" because, more than likely there will be a better way. So, sometimes it's better to say ""@CAPS6 with the new ways @MONEY1 doing things techno logically in with old ways @MONEY1 doing things manually."
6,"People should use computers, they do benefit to society. More and more people use them @DATE1 and agree that these virtual portals of information and communication are extremely helpful. Think about it, paper is made out of trees and of coarse to get the paper you must cut down the tree first, and then have it an through a whole wasteful process to get that paper.If everyone used computers we wouldn't have to cut down those beautifully, lush trees. And also, have you ever needed to get information fast? Well instead of going through a book and possibly searching for hours, finding that information on the internet would be so much faster! Lastly, in the future everything will eventually be run with computers, they are the then now and later! They'll never get old! Computers are extremely helpful with endless information. A lot of people @DATE1 are very sensitive about our environment and how we're treating the earth. They are looking for new ways to help the world be as green as possible. An easy alternative for paper is a computer. Once for school i was assigned a paper; i looked up the information on the computer easily, typed it up, and sent it by email to my teacher. Not a single piece of paper had been used! Ok so i know, computers use up a lot of energy, but to be honest they don't have to. Many people around the world use solar panels to gain their energy from the sun to power their lights, computers, etc.! The use of computers is extremely Eco friendly and like i said before is a great alternative to our everyday wasteful use of paper and pencil. Do you want to look up information fast? Well on the computer you can! All you do is type in what you need in a search engine and @CAPS1! you have the info you need! Instead of using a book (which wastes trees) to slowly find your information you can use a simple computer to do the job. A poll was token and shows that @PERCENT1 of students at @CAPS2 @CAPS3 school who use the computer to look up information get faster and more accurate results! Do you want that or slow information found in a boring book? The future is not far away. It is already @DATE2 and we are using the computer for so much. Ok so the computer does show to cause distractions and headaches if used too long, but it is a great invention of the future. Instead of going to a restaurant and ordering off we'll order of computers/touch screens. More and more people are coming up with beater and faster computers. Everyone is using computers and love it and they will differently be used in the future. I hope you see how amazing computers can be. They're ornamental useful and a great alternative to paper, they help you find the information you need fast, and professor grant states"" i do all my work on the computer, without it i would be lost."" And lastly they are the future of our world! They are the then now and later of the technical world."
6,"Dear @CAPS1 of my local newspaper, More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. These boxes can be harmful to their users' eyes. In addition, they lead to less interaction with real people. Finally, they lead to a very unhealthy lifestyle. Computers are harmful to our society. For starters, computers are harmful because they are very bad for our eyes. Between the @DATE1 @DATE2 and @DATE3, doctors saw nearly a @PERCENT1 increase in eye problems that resulted in either surgery, glasses, or contacts. This can be directly associated with the overuse of personal computers. Also, studies have shown that common citizens who use these contraptions for over four hours each day end up with an extremely deteriorated vision by the age of @NUM1. Finally, @CAPS2 @CAPS3 stated that overuse of computers have led to a very negative affect on the eyesight of their workers. It can be seen, how work gets done faster, however the cost of medical treatments actually surpasses the little extra profit gained by modernizing. Secondly, computers are harmful because they lead to less time being with real people. To begin with, studies have shown that people simply dint learn as much about their peers by talking to them through a box. Also, a study by the @ORGANIZATION1 has shown that there are roughly @PERCENT2 fewer conversations at social gatherings than just @DATE1. This is alarming because at that rate people @MONTH1 never get to know each other and the world @MONTH1 become an electronically based work space. Finally @PERSON1, social relations professional, stated that people end up with a lack of understanding when they cant feel the emotion a person has when he/she is speaking. Sure, you can video chat, but that still does not convey the real feeling behind a persons words. Finally, computers are harmful because they lead to a very unhealthy lifestyle. To begin with, the lack of fresh air obtained by sitting indoors all day is very bad for lungs and can lead to premature breathing problems. Also, average people get @PERCENT3 fewer workouts, according to @CAPS4s @CAPS5, which was not likely directly influenced by overuse of computers. Finally the obesity rate has risen from next to nothing to over @NUM2 in the past ten @DATE1. Research showed that the majority of the obese patients spent excessive time on their little boxes of ten. While you might feel that this is not completely due to computers, it has been proven time and time again that these machines are the main reason behind the worlds currently unhealthy lifestyle. Personal computers have a very negative effect toward the society of today. This technology has resulted in very poor eyesight in the general public. In addition, they lead to a much lower amount of social interaction. Finally, they end up forcing people into an unhealthy lifestyle. So, let the word out that computers are bad for society, and try to make the world a better place to live."
6,"Dear @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1 name us @PERSON1 from @LOCATION3, @LOCATION2. I thought it would benefit your opinion on the effects @ORGANIZATION1 computer usage throughout the @LOCATION1 if you heard from a young teen. This would help you because at @CAPS1 age people are dependent on computers! they can be entertained by online games, communicate with friends and family and receive news about what is happening around the world. Although some people do not always benefit by having a computer, most @ORGANIZATION1 the time people are satisfied, and do benefit from the use @ORGANIZATION1 computers. First off, people are affected by computers in a positive way because they can be entertained whether it is playing online games, or participating in a fantasy sports league. Although I just mentioned two noneducational examples, there are many educational websites on the internet which children can learn from. In @CAPS1 personal life I can name so many examples @ORGANIZATION1 entertainment. I use such as @CAPS2, which is an online game website, or fantasy football teams I am involved in. Another example @ORGANIZATION1 entertainment is when @CAPS1 younger brother. Parker goes on leaving websites. He will play on these websites for hours. Although he is slivering in front @ORGANIZATION1 a computer screen he is learning. Also, expert say that children in the throughout the world learn more from the computer then from a textbook, or hearing information from a teacher. They say this because a computer screen catches peoples attention. Learning is a major priority and if it means putting a child in front @ORGANIZATION1 a computer for an hour will improve this, then that is what will happen. @CAPS1 next reason why effect @ORGANIZATION1 computers on people is positive, is because it helps people communicated with friends or family. @CAPS1 brother is attending college at @ORGANIZATION1 and since we do not see him often. our family will video chat with him over a program called @ORGANIZATION4. Because @ORGANIZATION1 this program we are able to stay in touch. An online poll was put out on @DATE1 which asked how people regularly talk to friends, or family. Sixtythree percent @ORGANIZATION1 the votes showed that people communicate over the computer most @ORGANIZATION1 the time. Thirtytwo percent said over the phone and about sixteen percent said in person. this shows how much people communicate over the computer using, Facebook, @CAPS3 @CAPS4, and much more. I would say that the computer is a good effect ion people when used this way. Lastly, computers help people receive news about what is happening around the world. On the computer at @CAPS1 house, every time I open the internet there is breaking news about the war in @LOCATION6 devastation on @LOCATION5, and much more. Alsom a few months ago a class at @ORGANIZATION3 made a pie chart and discovered how their classmates find out world news. Fiftysix percent said they FUD out their news from computers. Not only is it @ORGANIZATION3 students but most people get news from the internet. Just the other night at dinner our waiter was from @LOCATION4 and he said he received all @ORGANIZATION1 his news about his hometown from the internet. As you can see many people use the internet on their computers to receive news and information. It is easy to tell that the effect computers have on people is positive because @ORGANIZATION1 the reasons I have stated above; people can be entertained, they can communicate with family and friends, and @MONTH1 receive news about what's happening around the world. Like I said on the first paragraph, not all the effects are positive but most @ORGANIZATION1 them are!"
6,"@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 technology majors support that the use of computers have a positive effect on people and I agree with them. I believe the use of computers are a necessity for social interaction, homework, research, and are a great source of entertain"
6,"To whom @CAPS5 @MONTH1 concern at @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS4 @CAPS5's possible, imagine a world @CAPS7 computers, @CAPS1 drivers are bumping around and having difficulty watching the wheel and the road, phone bills are through the roof because of the whole world having no other way of communicating, and students are home worried sick that they don't have a book to study with. Computers affect all of these areas of our lives. They teach hand eye coordination, allows us to communicate with others dozens of ways, and let students learn and stay updated from their very own home. Computers must stay a fundamental part of our every day. To begin, computers must remain in our community because they teach even young children hand eye coordination. In a recent report the @ORGANIZATION2 states that in the past five years; the number of driving students who pass on their first try has almost doubled. The video games, the computer mice, and even typing the brain at a young age to work in sync with the body's arms, finger and other append ages, ""@CAPS5's not only on the road where hand eye counts."" says @PERSON1, head of surgery at @ORGANIZATION1 hospital. ""@CAPS6 finding that younger doctors, ones that grew up on video and computer games, can form robotics surgery with much more precision than our older at endings."" @CAPS7 the coordination we acquire from the computer many jobs @MONTH1 be out of reach, too. When sacked, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 managers of local business said they would have someone who could type, over someone who couldn't. So, though you @MONTH1 think computers teach no they can coordination for the rest of a persons life. Secondly, computers should be part of homes because they allow people to communicate with others world. In a @DATE1 poll, only @PERCENT1 of @NUM3 years old had, but a recent poll says that @PERCENT2 now have opals. Computer have opened to communicate email, @CAPS8, social networking sites, just to name a few! Parenting @CAPS9 says that parents prefer there teens to email trends or @CAPS8 as apposed to talk on the phone because @CAPS5 quiets the house, the phone lines for others and keeps phone bill low. My friend once only talked online for a month and her parents encourage her because the phone decreased by a third, @CAPS5's clear that even though you @MONTH1 feel that computers take up time that could be spent with others, @CAPS5's actually a way to communicate with people everywhere. Finaly, computers can help students learn. In to days schools, students depend on homework being posted online, and getting their books over the web. Once, my brother didn't take home his book bag for a week, and got all online. We was grateful for the strain off his back. When asked @PERCENT3 of @NUM4 graders say they use books at least twice a week. the internet also is a valuable research tool. @NUM5 out of @NUM2 schools say they use a book for research less than once a month. As you can see, the internet is a valuable learning tool. In conclusion, computers help as with coordination, communication and education. Computers have nothing but positive effects on people on society as a whole."
6,"Dear Readers, Computers have a large presence in the world today. Most people in the @LOCATION1 have at least one and the number grows still. These computers are bad for people. They cost a lot of money cause people to stop exercising and become unhealthy, and teach children that things come easy in life. Computers cost a lot of money. Between buying one, purchasing hardware and protection, and paying for maintenance, they are very expensive. Dr. @PERSON2, a computer science expert, claims, ""The average computer costs @MONEY1. There is then hardware that needs to be bought and replaced, along with anti virus programs and other protection. Now we could be talking about @MONEY2 at the very least. With yearly maintenance costing about @MONEY3 per year, you can see how expensive these machines really are."" @CAPS1 out of every ten computer owners in a recent survey stated that they had to service their computers within the last three months. Thats a lot of many going toward fixing computers. But computers don't just cause money problems, there are health issues too. Computers take a lot of time away from people. When a computer is used, the user doesn't move around or exercise. Computers are making people unhealthy. The obesity number in the @LOCATION1 has skyrocketed, but it's not just food, Some experts are now contributing computer use to lack of exercise, and therefore, obesity. Dr. @DR1 @CAPS2 says, ""@CAPS3 matter what you're doing on a computer, be it games or education, you would be better off outside, moving around, getting exercise. A recent study shows that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 families who purchased a computer in the last year have halved their exercise and play time. There are health problems created by computers, but they also teach the next generation that things come very easily. Computers are an excellent source of knowledge, but that could be a problem. It is a quite easy to find something out, or research a topic using a computer. Before computers became popular, people had to work and look for @CAPS4. Now that it is so easy, children @MONTH1 begin to think things come easily in life. @PERSON1, a pediatric psychologist, says, ""The mind of a child works in a such a way, that most things they encounter are ab sorted and become normal. If a child becomes use to the ease of searching an item on a computer, he will expect all things to be equally simple. If they are not he @MONTH1 become frustrated and not be able to do what is needed."" @NUM3 out of @NUM4 poll takers agree that finding @CAPS4 on the computer is quite easy. What are the children of the world being taught? Life is easy, a false statement. Computer use is a growing problem. It costs ridiculous amounts of money, causes health problems, and poisons the minds of children to believe that life is an easy thing. Computers are bad for the people of the world, they take our money, our health and the minds of our children."
6,"Dear Local newspaper, @CAPS1 a world filled with gargantuan people seated at a mo niter, their eyes staring at it blankly. Outside the city streets are deserted, save for the squirrels running along fence posts. This is what will happen if people spend to much time on the computers. People will spend less time exercising, less time outdoors enjoying nature, and less time interacting with family and friends. This is why computers have a drastic negative affect on people. First of all, people send huge amounts of time on their computers and small amounts of time exercising. In a recent poll done by @ORGANIZATION3 magazine, it stated that @PERCENT1 of people between the ages of @NUM1 and @NUM2 prefer to be online rather than outside exercising. That article also states that since @DATE3, child obesity has increased by @PERCENT2! @PERSON2 of @ORGANIZATION1 at @ORGANIZATION4 states that  the reason child obesity has increased so much is because children spend so much time in front of the computer and less time outdoors. Do you want this rate to increase in the next ten years? Secondly, spending so much time inside decreases the time you spend outside enjoying nature. Bird watches monthly has had a decrease in subscriptions the @DATE1 because people are not interested in nature anymore. In a study done by @PERSON1 and his colleagues at @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS2 of @CAPS3 spend almost @PERCENT3 more time indoors in front of electronic devices, most frequently computers, then they do out doors. @PERSON3 says, @CAPS4 to the new advancements in technology, people are to spend more time indoors than outdoors and that percentage will most likely increase as the decade proceeds. Finally, spending so much time in front of the computer leaves you less time to interact with family and friends. In @DATE4 more than @PERCENT4 of family ate dinner together now, only @PERCENT5 eat together usually because they are in separate rooms in front of a mo niter. This also leads to higher crime rate, believe it or not. Because young children and adolescents dint have the person to support and guide them because they dint spend time together @CAPS4 to the frequent use of computers, there is a @PERCENT6 chance that child will commit a crime compared to the @PERCENT7 chance a child would in @DATE5. Do you want that for our youth? Now @CAPS1 a world where people jog together in the park, as they jog, they see a group of bird watchers huddled together under a tree. As the joggers proceed, they come to a pavilion and see a big family celebrating the @DATE2 of a family member. This happy thought wont become a reality if people spend too much time on their computers and less time exercising ,enjoying nature, and less time interacting with family and friends. So, local newspaper I encourage you, to encourage others, to get outside and spend less time in front of the computer. You have the power to make a difference in your real lives. But the question is, will you?"
6,"Dear @CAPS1 Society: Computers are perhaps one of the greatest improvements to our societies advancement in knowledge in the past few decades. These gems of future, are like a human being; they have their own mind and can figure out answers to all problems. People all around the world use them, from @LOCATION5 to @LOCATION4, to @LOCATION2 to @LOCATION1, they are being used. People from ages of school kids, to adults who have a job so highly appreciated as a chemist, use computers! Do you wish to be that one standing on the side lines, stuck in the past, not advancing with technology? From the creations of rockets, engines and planes; computers have never let us down. Still, the question is this: will computerized technology benefit our society or crash it down? Ever since the @DATE1, computers have been used as an ad for new information. The speed that they are able to receive new information in is just astonishing! @CAPS2 @PERSON2, computer engineer, says ""With the technology that we receive from computers, we are able to be in the game."" @CAPS2 just comes to show one of the best benefits of computers: their ability to display the most current information. Now, I can see how books are an excellent resource in society, and how they provide for amazing information, however it takes years to publish books! With the use of a computer, information that occur ed sometimes as close to @NUM1 hours ago can appear on the internet! Not only will this allow you to get information faster, but it will allow our society to ""be in the game."" You catch a football as it soars through the air, you track a baseball or it flays high in the sky, you grasp the face of a basketball all because you have ""hand eye"" coordination. Handeye coordination is perhaps one of the most necessary aspects of life that a person can have. Face it, everybody needs it! So why not help your body to get that talent: buy a computer. Imagine, our society would advance in it's sports and even just with life if they learn how to coordinate themselves. Did you know that @NUM2 out of @NUM3 people who owned a computer and typed daily were able to catch all three tennis balls that were thrown at them! You could do that too! When typing on a computer, human development observers states, your eyes a free tracked on the screen and you train your hands to maneuver about the keys all by themselves. Just as in basketball, when you train your hand to track the bounce of the ball without you needing the need to catch it. I can remember when I started typing, my hands began to naturally find the keys without me having to look at them. And the next day at basketball practice I felt like @CAPS3 amazing point guard @PERSON1, the ball just came straight to my hand! Get this need of life, invest in a computer! Money @MONTH1 be the most vital thing in our society right now. With profits as low as medium wage, our local area is not that ""rich."" I can see how it could be hard, having to purchase these computers at prices as high as @MONEY1 each. But then just think, each book that we won't have to purchase would save us @NUM4 each. Not only do computer's stand to last @NUM5 longer than any paperback, their information is always new, changing, and updated. In order for us to be purchasing new books because of recent information would end up coasting as more in the long run. Our neighboring society of @LOCATION3 just invested in over @NUM6 computers for their society. The stated that it took inlet @NUM7 months to get the money back that they had purchased on the computer's with the amount that had not purchasing book! Now just imagine how much money our society would gain after @NUM8 year! It is necessary for our society to have computers. With them we not only learn hand eye coordination but we invest in more money for the. And now with so many things happening in the world it is important to receive information instantly from these computers. I can't stress enough that without them we just @MONTH1 be less in the rest. Dreams of incredible rockets and medicines and cures far diseases just won't happen. Computers rise perhaps the only thing that actually benefits our society. You must understand how important this technology is to our society! But, int the long run, the decision is yours is make. Choose quickly, the fate of our society is in your hands."
